this life is a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight you should have asked me  years ago there were wars to fight women to marry we never had the chance to be young i recall a few chances there was that one oh what was her name that common girl of yours becca with the great big tits you could bury your face in bessie she was one of yours bessie thank the gods for bessie i suppose it is preferable to beheading and her tits yours was er aleena no you told me once er meryl your bastards mother wylla  thats it she must have been a rare wench to make lord eddard stark forget his honour you never told me what she looked like nor will i we were at war what did ned stark want you for none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again youre too hard on yourself you always have been i swear if i werent your king youd have hit me already the worst thing about your coronation ill never get to hit you again trust me thats not the worst thing there was a rider in the night daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord what of it do we send her a wedding gift a knife perhaps a good sharp one buying from a slaver and a bold man to wield it shes little more than a child soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding tell me were not speaking of this  oh its unspeakable to you what her father did to your family  that was unspeakable what rhaegar targaryen did to your sister the woman i loved ill kill every targaryen i get my hands on but you cant get your hands on this one can you this khal drogo selling to one its said he has  men in his horde even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm as long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea they have no ships robert there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper if the targaryen boy crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the scum will join him  he will not cross and if by chance he does well throw him back into the sea theres a war coming ned i dont know when i dont know who well be fighting some poachers i caught on my land but its coming sit youll be fed untie them ah rapers they were given a choice no doubt  castration or the wall most choose the knife not impressed by your new brothers lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one under my reign you wont be punished for such nonsense why do you read so much look at me and tell me what you see is this a trick what you see is a dwarf if id been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for  years until your brother killed that king yes until my brother killed him you can rest assured of that life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honour of my house wouldnt you agree but how well my brother has his sword and i have my mind and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone thats why i read so much jon snow and you betterlooking bitches than youre used to uncle whats your story bastard ask me nicely and maybe ill tell you dwarf a bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the nights watch alongside his valiant brothersinarms the nights watch protects the realm from ah yes yes against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about youre a smart boy you dont believe that nonsense isnt there anything else my mothers been looking for you everythings better with some wine in the belly its time we reviewed the accounts my lady youll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us talk to poole about it poole went south with lord stark my lady we need a new steward and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention  i dont care about appointments ill make the appointments well talk about it first thing in the morning we ride for kings landing today very good my lord my lady when was the last time you left this room i have to take care of him hes not going to die mother maester luwin says the most dangerous time has passed

the windows i cant stand it please make them stop fire you stay here ill come back youre not supposed to be here no one is supposed to be here its a mercy hes dead already no have you ever seen a dragon  dragon gone khaleesi and offer your sympathies everywhere even in the east no dragon brave men kill them it is known  it is known a trader from qarth told me that dragons come from the moon the moon he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi that once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire what good will my sympathies do them moon is no egg moon is goddess  wife of sun it is known  it is known leave me with her why did the trader from qarth tell you these stories men like to talk when theyre happy before your brother bought me for you it was my job to make men happy how old were you i was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house nine none but it is expected of you i did not touch a man for three years khaleesi first you must learn can you teach me how to make the khal happy yes will it take three years no welcome what i am about to tell you must remain between us i dont think bran fell from that tower i think he was thrown your absence has already been noted the boy was always surefooted before someone tried to kill him twice why why murder an innocent child unless he saw something he wasnt meant to see saw what my lady  i dont know but i would stake my life the lannisters are involved we already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown did you notice the dagger the killer used its too fine a weapon for such a man the blade is valyrian steel the handle dragonbone the boy means nothing to me someone gave it to him they come into our home and try to murder my brother if its war they want if it comes to that you know ill stand behind you what is there going to be a battle in the godswood hmm too easily words of war become acts of war we dont know the truth yet lord stark must be told of this i dont trust a raven to carry these words and i cant stand the wailing of women ill ride to kings landing  no there must always be a stark in winterfell i will go myself  mother you cant i must ill send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you too large a party attracts unwanted attention i dont want the lannisters to know im coming let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone what about bran one word and ill hit you again i have prayed to the seven for more than a month brans life is in their hands now no khaleesi you must look in his eyes always love comes in at the eyes it is said that irogenia of lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes finish a man oh kings travelled across the world for a night with irogenia the dothraki have two things in abundance  grass and horses im telling mother magisters sold their palaces khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours they say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all well she sounds like an interesting woman i i dont think that drogo will like it with me on top you will make him like it khaleesi men want what theyve never had and the dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch go tell her are you a slave khaleesi then dont make love like a slave very good khaleesi out there he is the mighty khal but in this tent he belongs to you i i dont think that this is the dothraki way if he wanted the dothraki way why did he marry you no but first you will get to lord and lady stark no tonight i would look upon your face pardon me ser do i frighten you so much girl or is it him there making you shake he frightens me too look at that face im sorry if i offended you ser why wont he speak to me he hasnt been very talkative these last  years and you will fall on your knees in front of them since the mad king had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers he speaks

2,3,8.7,1,welcome lord stark sturdy old thing thats not true you killed the beast you only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father i didnt i when aerys targaryen sat on the iron throne your father was a rebel and a traitor someday youll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it do i have to marry her yes shes very beautiful and young if you dont like her you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses how many kings arses have polished it i wonder and if youd rather fuck painted whores youll fuck painted whores and if youd rather lie with noble virgins so be it you are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be do something nice for the stark girl i dont want to  no but you will the occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road we allow the northerners too much power they consider themselves our equals how would you handle them id double their taxes and command them to supply  men to the royal army um whats the line a royal army why should every lord command his own men its primitive no better than the hill tribes we should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown trained by experienced soldiers instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives and if the northerners rebel id crush them seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the north uncle kevan maybe the king shits and the hand wipes and these  northern troops would they fight for you or their lord for me im their king  mmhm but youve just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brothers  im not asking the north cannot be held not by an outsider its too big and too wild and when the winter comes the seven gods together couldnt save you and your royal army a good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies very handsome armour so you agree the starks are enemies everyone who

when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness that is the time for fear my little lord when the white walkers move through the woods thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation they didnt deserve to die like that kings froze to death in their castles same as the shepherds in their huts and women smothered their babies rather than see them starve and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks so is this the sort of story that you like in that darkness the white walkers came for the first time they swept through cities and kingdoms riding their dead horses hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds what are you telling him now nobody deserves to die like that only what the little lord wants to hear get your supper i want some time with him one time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant named macomber maybe we do how do you feel you still dont remember anything

legs id rather be dead dont ever say that  id rather be dead fewer eyes back here my lady but still too many its nine years since ive set foot in the capital and no one knew who i was the last time i

the strangest stories valyrian steel do you know whose dagger this is i must admit i do not no lord stark well well this is an historic day something you dont know that i do theres only one dagger like this in all of the seven kingdoms its mine  yours at least it was until the tournament on prince joffreys last nameday i bet on ser jaime in the jousting as any sane man would when the knight of the flowers unseated him i lost this dagger to whom tyrion lannister the honour of your presence is requested men and this room was silent as a crypt the imp grenn show him what you farm boys are made of if that were a real sword youd be dead lord snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you pyp do you think ned starks bastard bleeds like the rest of us next next well lord snow it appears youre the least useless person here go clean yourselves up except for the screams of course theres only so much i can stomach in a day a charming man i dont need him to be charming i need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the nights watch and hows that going commander mormont slowly a raven came for ned starks son good news or bad both and the mad king laughing lord stark i meant to give you this earlier so forgetful these days a raven from winterfell this morning good news perhaps youd like to share it with your wife my wife is in winterfell  is she yes im looking at you i thought that shed be safest in here one of several such establishments i own and later youre a funny man huh a very funny man ned ah the starks quick tempers slow minds you broke my nose bastard its an improvement if we threw you over the wall i wonder how long it would take you to hit i wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did what are you looking at halfman when i watched the mad king die im looking at you yes youve got an interesting face hmm very distinctive faces all of you and what do you care about our faces its just i think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in kings landing perhaps ill write to my sister the queen about it well talk later lord snow everybody knew what this place was and no one told me i remembered him laughing as your father burned no one but you my father knew and he left me to rot at the wall all the same grenns father left him too outside a farmhouse when he was three pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese his little sister hadnt eaten in three days he was given a choice  his right hand or the wall ive been asking the lord commander about them fascinating stories they hate me because im better than they are its a lucky thing none of them were trained by a masteratarms like your ser rodrik it felt like justice i dont imagine any of them had ever held a real sword before they came here oh your brother bran hes woken up the mere suggestion that the queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason we have proof we have the blade which lord tyrion will say was stolen from him the only man who could say otherwise has no throat is that what you tell yourself at night thanks to your boys wolf petyr has promised to help us find the truth hes like a little brother to me ned he would never betray my trust ill try to keep you alive for her sake a fools task admittedly but ive never been able to refuse your wife anything i wont forget this youre a true friend dont tell anyone i have a reputation to maintain how could you be so stupid  calm down youre a servant of justice hes a child ten years old what were you thinking  i was thinking of us youre a bit late to start complaining about it now what has the boy told them  nothing he remembers nothing then what are you raving about what if it comes back to him if he tells his father what he saw well say he was lying well say he was dreaming well say whatever we like i think we can outfox a tenyearold and my husband  ill go to war with him if i have to they can write a ballad about us that you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in aerys targaryens back the war for cerseis cunt let me go  never let me go  the boy wont talk and if he does ill kill him him ned stark the king  the whole bloody lot of them until you and i are the only people left in this world i wish i could see the girls its too dangerous  just for a moment until we know who our enemies are i know they did it ned the lannisters get the girls settled in ill be back in time for supper tell me if id stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back in my bones i know it littlefingers right i cant do anything without proof and if you find the proof then i bring it to robert and hope hes still the man i once knew you watch yourself on the road huh that temper of yours is a dangerous thing my temper gods be good you nearly killed poor littlefinger yesterday would you admire me more he still loves you does he off with you yes its been a long time but i still remember every face you remember your first of course your grace who was it a tyroshi never learned the name  hmm you served him well when serving was safe how did you do it lance through the heart quick one lucky for you mine was some tarly boy at the battle of summerhall my horse took an arrow so i was on foot slogging through the mud he came running at me this dumb highborn lad thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword i knocked him down with the hammer gods i was strong then lord stark caved in his breastplate probably shattered every rib he had stood over him hammer in the air right before i brought it down he shouted wait wait they never tell you how they all shit themselves they dont put that part in the songs stupid boy now the tarlys bend the knee like everyone else he could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable lord varys his sons would be ingrates and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl wine lancel gods what a stupid name lancel lannister who named you some halfwit with a stutter what are you doing its empty your grace  what do you mean its empty theres no more wine  is that what empty means so get more i was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the kingsroad tell your cousin to get in here kingslayer get in here surrounded by lannisters every time i close my eyes i see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces it must wound your pride huh standing out there like a glorified sentry jaime lannister son of the mighty tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks so come on we are all praying for prince joffreys full recovery were telling war stories who was your first kill not counting old men one of the outlaws in the brotherhood i was there that day you were only a squire  years old you killed simon toyne with a counter riposte best move i ever saw a good fighter toyne but he lacked stamina your outlaw any last words a shame you didnt say a prayer for the butchers son i cut his head off so no  hmm what about aerys targaryen what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back i never asked did he call you a traitor did he plead for a reprieve he said the same thing hed been saying for hours burn them all if thats all your grace do the dothraki buy their slaves renly youre looking well the dothraki dont believe in money most of their slaves were given to them as gifts from whom if you rule a city and you see the horde approaching you have two choices pay tribute or fight an easy choice for most of course sometimes its not enough sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves hes given he might think the men too weak or the women too ugly sometimes a khal decides his riders havent had a good fight in months and you look tired from the road and need the practice tell them all to stop you want the entire horde to stop for how long until i command them otherwise youre learning to talk like a queen not a queen a khaleesi you dare you give commands to me to me you do not command the dragon i am lord of the seven kingdoms and jory you go with them  yes my lord i told them this meeting could wait another day but i dont take orders from savages or their sluts do you hear me rakharo ask if you want him dead khaleesi no rakharo say you should take ear to teach respect please please dont hurt him tell him i dont want my brother harmed huh mormont kill these dothraki dogs i am your king shall we return to the khalasar khaleesi but we have a kingdom to look after uh uh uh uh uh you walk i wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time im leaving this morning  youre leaving im the first ranger my job is out there there have been disturbing reports  what kind of reports the kind i dont want to believe im ready i wont let you down youre not going ive hoped to meet you for some time lord stark youre no ranger jon but im better than every  better than no one here a man gets what he earns when he earns it well speak when i return a bears balls   oh youre joking and his brains and his guts his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat when youre a hundred miles north of the wall no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me  she has lord baelish and you ate your last meal a week ago you leave nothing for the wolves and how do a bears balls taste a bit chewy and what about you my lord whats the strangest thing youve eaten do dornish girls count so you roam the seven kingdoms collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bring them here as eager recruits aye but its not all of ems done bad things some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed i understand you knew my brother brandon as well some of ems highborn lads looking for glory they have a better chance finding feed than glory the nights watch is a joke to you is it is that what we are lannister an army of jesters in black you dont have enough men to be an army and aside from yoren here none of you are particularly funny i hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell when youre back in kings landing its something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothels all too well i still carry a token of his esteem half the boys youve seen training will die north of the wall might be a wildlings axe that gets them might be sickness might just be the cold they die in pain and they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort do you think im plump listen benjen may i call you benjen  call me what you like im not sure what ive done to offend you from navel to collarbone i have great admiration for the nights watch ive great admiration for you as first ranger you know my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but really counts but i dont believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the wall i believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when that wall went up our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with youre right the wildlings are no different from us a little rougher maybe but theyre made of meat and bone i know how to track them and i know how to kill them its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights youve never been north of the wall so dont tell me whats out there are you going below keep well keep warm  enjoy the capital brother oh i always do it wasnt the man that i chose my lord i think hes starting to like me going below  aye into the tunnel and out the other side hell be north of the wall for a month or two so youre heading down to kings landing too aye day after tomorrow i get about half of my recruits from their dungeons lets share the road i could use some decent company i er i travel a bit on the grubby side my lord it was catelyn tully not this time well be staying at the finest castles and inns no one turns away a lannister yes khaleesi oh what are you doing when was last time you bleed khaleesi you change khaleesi its a blessing from the great stallion for a man on horseback the curved blade is a good thing easier to handle its a good weapon for a dothrakan if youd like to change into something more appropriate a woman worth fighting for im sure youll agree but a man in full plate the arakh wont get through the steel thats where the broadsword has the advantage designed for piercing plate dothraki dont wear steel dresses armour   armour armour make a man erm slow slow  its true but it also keeps a man alive my father taught me how to fight i humbly beg your pardon my lord stark he taught me that speed defeats size ive heard that your father was a famous warrior he was bloodrider to khal bharbo and your father jorah the andal he was a warrior also he still is a man of great honour and i betrayed him the khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight kill some rabbits there are no rabbits grand maester find some ducks she likes ducks have you seen any ducks woman no rabbits no ducks do you have eyes in your head do you dog then i have seen many dogs i dont think she wants to eat dog the khaleesi have baby inside her it is true she does not bleed for two moons her belly start to swell a blessing from the great stallion she does not want to eat horse how many years has it been ill have the boys butcher a goat for supper i need to ride to qohor uh we ride for vaes dothrak dont worry ill catch you the hordes easy to find dont stand so still its harder to hit a moving target except for you you move too much i could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me how many winters have you seen lord tyrion eight no nine you were a young man  and you served another king all of them brief they say the winter of my birth was three years long maester aemon this summer has lasted nine but reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter the starks are always right eventually winter is coming this one will be long and dark things will come with it weve been capturing wildlings more every month theyre fleeing south oh how forgetful of me the ones who flee say theyve seen the white walkers yes and the fishermen of lannisport say they see mermaids one of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions he swore it right up to the moment ned stark chopped his head off the nights watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men there are less than a thousand of us now we cant man the other castles on the wall we cant properly patrol the wilderness this belongs to you now weve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed your sister sits by the side of the king tell her we need help when winter does come gods help us all if were not ready its a boy how do you know i know im sorry to see you leave lannister its either me or this cold and it doesnt appear to be going anywhere should we begin will you stop at winterfell on your way south i expect i will gods know there arent many feather beds between here and kings landing if you see my brother bran tell him i miss him tell him id visit if i could of course hell never walk again if youre going to be a cripple its better to be a rich cripple you take care snow without the king  winter may be coming farewell my lord you are late boy tomorrow you will be here at midday who are you your dancing master syrio forel tomorrow you will catch it now pick it up that is not the way boy it is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it its too heavy  it is heavy as it needs to be but im afraid the same cannot be said for my brother to make you strong just so one hand is all that is needed now you are standing all wrong turn your body sideface yes so you are skinny that is good the target is smaller now the grip  let me see thank the gods youre here stark his grace has many cares yes the grip must be delicate what if i drop it the steel must be part of your arm can you drop part of your arm no nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos he knows these things you must listen to me boy im a girl boy girl you are a sword that is all that is the grip he entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load you are not holding a battleaxe you are holding a needle ahhh just so now we will begin the dance remember child this is not the dance of the westeros we are learning the knights dance hacking and hammering this is the braavos dance the water dance we are the lords of small matters here it is swift and sudden all men are made of water do you know this if you pierce them the water leaks out and they die now you will try to strike me ha up ha my brother instructs us to stage a tournament ah dead oh dead hup very dead come ah ah ah hup again faster in honour of lord starks appointment as hand of the king ah mm how much   gold dragons to the champion to the runnerup to the winning archer can the treasury bear such expense ill have to borrow it the lannisters will accommodate i expect about time we had some stern northern leadership we already owe lord tywin three million gold whats another are you telling me the crown is three million in debt im telling you the crown is six million in debt  how could you let this happen the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it i will not believe jon arryn allowed robert to bankrupt the realm lord arryn gave wise and prudent advice but i fear his grace doesnt always listen counting coppers he calls it ill speak to him tomorrow this tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford glad to see youre protecting the throne as you will but still wed best make our plans there will be no plans until i speak to robert forgive me my lords im i had a long ride  you are the kings hand lord stark we serve at your pleasure ow  please its nearly healed its ugly  a king should have scars you fought off a direwolf youre a warrior like your father im not like him i didnt fight off anything it bit me and all i did was scream and the two stark girls saw it both of them ,5060

im a coward hodor my father always says so  the walls no place for cowards youre right im sorry i just wanted to thank you a bloody coward people saw us talking to him now theyll think were cowards too youre too stupid to be a coward youre too stupid to be a  quick now before summers over come here hyah hyah i must say i received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit vaes dothrak  the city of the horselords a pile of mud mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do  these are my people now you shouldnt call them savages  ill call them what i like because theyre my people this is my army khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army if my brother was given an army of dothraki could you conquer the seven kingdoms the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea they fear any water their horses cant drink any man of the nights watch is welcome at winterfell but if they did king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle but the men advising him are different and you know these men  i fought beside them once long ago now ned stark wants my head he drove me from my land you sold slaves aye why  i had no money any man of the nights watch but not i eh boy and an expensive wife and where is she now in another place with another man your grace  yes my dear they call you the last dragon they do you have dragons blood in your veins its entirely possible what happened to the dragons im not your boy lannister i was told that brave men killed them all the brave men didnt kill dragons the brave men rode them rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne which the usurper is keeping warm for me the swords of the vanquished a thousand of them melted together like so many candles im lord of winterfell while my father is away i have always wanted to see a dragon theres nothing in the world that i would rather see really why dragons they can fly and wherever they are just a few flaps of their wings and theyre somewhere else far away and they can kill anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing then you might learn a lords courtesy melted like so many candles ow yes seeing a dragon would make me very happy well after  years in a pleasure house i imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy i was not locked in i have seen things what have you seen  ive seen a man from asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass ooh  ive seen a man who could so its true change his face the way that other men change their clothes and ive seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of coloured silk so have you seen one a pirate ship  a dragon no no the last one died many years before i was born ill tell you what i have seen their skulls hello bran they used to decorate the throne room in the red keep when i was very young just three or four my father used to walk me down the rows and id recite their names for him when i got them all right hed give me a sweet the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls but but as you got closer to the iron throne they got bigger and bigger and bigger we have visitors  i dont want to see anyone do you remember anything about what happened there was ghiscar and valryon vermithrax essovius archonei meraxes vhagar and balerion the dread whose fire forged the seven kingdoms into one he has no memory of that day what happened to the skulls i dont know the usurper had them smashed to powder i expect scattered to the wind thats very sad  yes it is what did i buy you for to make me sad  no your grace to uh teach your sister to teach my sister how to be a better lover you think i bought you to make khal drogo happy curious  why are you here oh you pretty little idiot go on then get on with it someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side and one day before too long you will present your son to the court all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince what if i have a girl  gods be good youll have boys and girls and plenty of them what if i only have girls i wouldnt worry about that jeyne pooles mother had five children  all of them girls would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel yes but its highly unlikely but what if well if you only had girls i suppose the throne would pass to prince joffreys little brother and everyone would hate me nobody could ever hate you joffrey does  nonsense why would you say such a thing that business with the wolves sansa ive told you a hundred times my neck is beginning to hurt  kneel hodor a direwolf is not  please shut up about it do you remember your lessons who built the iron throne  aegon the conqueror and who built the red keep  maegor the cruel and how many years did it take to build my grandfather and uncle were murdered here werent they they were killed on the orders of king aerys yes the mad king  commonly known as the mad king why were they killed you should speak to your father about these matters do you like to ride bran  yes i dont want to speak to my father ever sansa you will find it in your heart to forgive your father  no i wont its the hands tournament thats causing all this trouble my lords the kings tournament i assure you the hand wants no part of it call it what you will lord stark ser the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day last night we had a tavern riot a brothel fire three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters dreadful  if you cant keep the kings peace well i mean i did like to perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can i need more men   youll get lord baelish will see it paid for  i will you found money for a champions purse you can find money to keep the peace ill also give you  of my household guard till the crowds have left  thank you my lord hand ser they will be put to good use the sooner this is over the better the realm prospers from such events my lord they give the great a chance at glory and the lowly a respite from their woes the boy has lost the use of his legs  what of it and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged im sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket hmm  now if theres nothing else my lords oh this heat on days like this i envy you northerners your summer snows until tomorrow my lord ive been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn lord arryn with the right horse and saddle even a cripple can ride oh his death was a great sadness to all of us i took personal charge of his care but i could not save him his sickness struck him very hard and very fast i saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed lord jon often came to me for counsel  why i have been grand maester for many years kings and hands have come to me for advice since what did jon want the night before he died oh he came inquiring after a book a book what book im not a cripple  then im not a dwarf oh i fear it would be of little interest to you my lord a a ponderous tome no id like to read it the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children harkon umber first of his name born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber really if i was cooped up all day my father will rejoice to hear it in the rd year after aegons landing at the last hearth blue of eye brown of hair and fair complected died in his th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt as i said my lord a ponderous read did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it he did not my lord and i did not presume to ask jons death  such a tragedy did he say anything to you during his final hours nothing of import my lord i have a gift for you oh there was one phrase he kept repeating the seed is strong i think it was the seed is strong  mmm what does that mean  oh the dying mind is a demented mind lord stark for all the weight theyre given last words are usually as significant as first words and youre quite certain he died of a natural illness what else could it be poison  a disturbing thought give that to your saddler hell provide the rest no no no i dont think it likely the hand was loved by all what sort of man would dare ive heard it said that poison is a womans weapon yes women cravens and eunuchs did you know that lord varys is a eunuch everybody knows that  yes yes of course how that sort of person found himself on the kings council i will never know  ive taken enough of your time no trouble at all my lord its a great honour you must shape the horse to the rider thank you ill find my own way out syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours its a hard fall down these steps syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better tomorrow im going to be chasing cats  cats syrio says he says every swordsman should study cats theyre as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers you have to be quick to catch them  hes right about that now that brans awake will he come live with us start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boys voice well he needs to get his strength back first he wants to be a knight of the kingsguard he cant be one now can he  no but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the kings council or he might raise castles like brandon the builder can i be lord of a holdfast you will marry a high lord and rule his castle and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords hmm  no will i really be able to ride  you will thats not me hello ser alliser said im to be your new watch partner i should warn you i dont see all

land and title tomorrow youre going to take the black forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north if you do not he said then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble is this some kind of trick why do you want to help him and youll be thrown from your saddle to die or so ill tell your mother nothing would please me more ser allisers going to make me fight

in a large house at the top of the street of steel why  i have my observers as i said and its possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armourer several times in the weeks before his death lord

thoros of myr charging through the breach with his burning sword ill remember that till the day i die i saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop theon hes a good lad  i doubt it ill bet you smell of blackberry jam let me smell it come here can i leave this with you the message from lord stark i dont serve lord stark what happened here where is

sam what are you waiting for attack him you get in there hit me go on hit me anyway you dont have a choice robbs waiting where did she go  mladys whereabouts i yield yield yield i yield you think this is funny do you when youre out there beyond the wall with the sun going down do you want a man at your back or a snivelling boy you send this whore to give me commands i should have sent you back her head forgive me khaleesi i did as you asked mlady hush now its all right irri take her and leave us yes khaleesi why did you hit her  how many times do i have to tell you you do not command me  i wasnt commanding you i just wanted to invite you to supper whats this  its a gift i had it made for you  dothraki rags are you going to dress me now  please this stinks of manure all of it stop stop stop it your loyalty to your captors is touching you would turn me into one of them wouldnt you next youll want to braid my hair  youve no right to a braid youve won no victories yet  you do not talk back to me you are a horselords slut and now youve woken the dragon i am a khaleesi of the dothraki i am the wife of the great khal and i carry his son inside me the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands i know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in moles town i wouldnt doubt it tell me how do you think balon greyjoy would feel dont you think its a little bit unfair making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side sally on the side  its silly isnt it what we cant defend the wall unless were celibate its absurd  i didnt think youd be so upset about it why not because im fat no  but i like girls just as much as you do they might not like me as much ive never been with one if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey youve probably had hundreds no as a matter of fact im the same as you yeah yeah i i find that hard to believe i came very close once i was alone in a room with a naked girl but didnt know where to put it  i know where to put it was she i still remember seeing my fathers fleet burn in lannisport old and ugly young and gorgeous a whore named ros what colour hair red  oh i like red hair and her um her you dont want to know  what that good better  oh no so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect i believe your uncles were responsible  must have been a pretty sight whats my name  jon snow and why is my surname snow because youre a bastard from the north i never met my mother my father wouldnt even tell me her name i dont know if shes living or dead i dont know if shes a noblewoman or a fishermans wife or a whore so i sat there nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive in the brothel as ros took off her clothes but i couldnt do it because all i could think was what if i got her pregnant and she had a child another bastard named snow its not a good life for a child ah mmm so you didnt know where to put it enjoying yourselves you look cold boys yes a great victory for your people shame how it all turned out it is a bit nippy a bit nippy yeah by the fire indoors its still summer do you boys even remember the last winter how long has it been now what  years i remember was it uncomfortable at winterfell were there days when you just couldnt get warm never mind how many fires your servants built we were outnumbered ten to one  a stupid rebellion then i build my own fires  thats admirable i spent six months out there beyond the wall during the last winter it was supposed to be a twoweek mission we heard a rumour mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch so we went out to look for some of his men capture them gather some knowledge the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men harder than youll ever be they know their country better than we do i dont want to go  neither do i i suppose your father realised that when your brothers died in battle they knew there was a storm coming in so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass and we got caught in the open wind so strong it yanked foot trees straight from the ground roots and all if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss you lost a finger to the frost and all in darkness you dont know cold neither of you do now here you are your enemys squire the horses died first we didnt have enough to feed them to keep them warm eating the horses was easy but later when we started to fall that wasnt easy we should have had a couple of boys like you along shouldnt we soft fat boys like you wed have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup soon well have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander careful imp  ive offended you for assignment and they will call you men of the nights watch but youd be fools to believe it youre boys still and come the winter you will die like flies i hit him i hit the dragon your brother rhaegar was the last dragon viserys is less than the shadow of a snake forgive me its been a rough morning he is still the true king  the truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne no but the common people are waiting for him illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return the common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends they dont care what games the high lords play what do you pray for ser jorah home i pray for home too anyway dont despair my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms he couldnt lead an army even if my husband gave him one hell never take us home lovers quarrel im sorry do i sansa dear this is lord baelish hes known  an old friend of the family ive known your mother a long long time why do they call you littlefinger  arya dont be rude  no its quite all right im a constant disappointment to my own father when i was a child i was very small and i come from a little spit of land called the fingers so you see its an exceedingly clever nickname ive been sitting here for days start the damn joust before i piss myself gods whos that ser gregor clegane they call him the mountain the hounds older brother and his opponent   ser hugh of the vale and ive learned to live with it he was jon arryns squire look how far hes come yes yes enough of the bloody pomp have at him not what you were expecting has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound lovely little tale of brotherly love the hound was just a pup six years old maybe gregor a few years older already a big lad already getting a bit of a reputation your next tumble with ros is on me some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire gregors toy a wooden knight gregor never said a word he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals held him there while the boy screamed while his face melted there arent very many people who know that story ill try not to wear her out i wont tell anyone i promise  no please dont if the hound so much as heard you mention it im afraid all the knights in kings landing would not be able to save you my lord her grace the queen your grace  youre missing your tournament putting my name on it doesnt make it mine i thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us the ugliness with the wolves and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned shoulder legs how is sansa she likes it here  shes the only stark who does favours her mother not much of the north in her what are you doing here  i might ask the same of you what is it you hope to accomplish the king called on me to serve him and the realm and thats what ill do until he tells me otherwise you cant change him you cant help him hell do what he wants which is all hes ever done youll try your best to pick up the pieces but robbs lord of winterfell leg shoulder leg if thats my job then so be it youre just a soldier arent you you take your orders and you carry on i suppose it makes sense your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow i was also trained to kill my enemies your grace as was i seven blessings to you goodfolk and to you boy bread meat and beer quickly left foot forward good ah good idea grandfather im starving a song while we wait or  id

4,5,9.1,1,does ser hugh have any family in the capital but who holds the straws in garb of red and gold this isnt the kingsroad you said we were riding for winterfell  i did often and loudly very wise theyll be out in droves looking for me in the wrong place words probably gotten to my father by now hell be offering a handsome reward everyone knows a lannister always pays his debts would you be so good as to untie me and why would i do that  why not youve done good work sisters am i going to run the hill tribes would kill me for my boots unless a shadowcat ate me first shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns ah the eastern road were going to the vale youre taking me to your sisters to answer for my imagined crimes tell me lady stark when was the last time you saw your sister five years ago  shes changed she was always a bit touched but now you might as well kill me here i am not a murderer lannister  neither am i life is strange i had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life the dagger found  what sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade should i gag him  why am i starting to make sense rodrik my lady this way untie me if i die whats the point ah not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident rodrik  ill be fine my lady theres no need to bloody yourself your first you need a woman nothing like a woman after a fight im willing if she is bran the iron islands sigil  a kraken words  we do not sow lords  the greyjoys im glad we never met on the field ser barristan famed for their skills at archery navigation and lovemaking and failed rebellions sigil  a stag a crowned stag now that roberts king good  words  ours is the fury lords  the baratheons  mmhm the westerlands sigil  a lion  mmm words  a lannister always pays his debts  no a common saying but not their official motto lords  the lannisters as is my wife i dont think the widows life would suit her were still on their words  i dont know them you do know them think unbowed unbent unbroken thats house martell  righteous in wrath house hornwood  family duty honour those are tully words  your mothers are we playing a game  family duty honour is that the right order  you know it is family comes first your mother had to leave winterfell to protect the family youre too modest how can she protect the family if shes not with her family your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept and then she left when you were born i was the one who pulled you from your mother i placed you in her arms from that moment until the moment she dies she will love you absolutely ive seen you cut down a dozen great knights fiercely  why did she leave i still cant tell you but she will be home soon  do you know where she is now today no i dont  then how can you promise me shell be home soon sometimes i worry youre too smart for your own good ill never shoot another arrow and where is that written you need legs to work a bow  hmm my father once told me you were the best hed ever seen if the saddle lord tyrion designed actually works you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback really dothraki boys learn when theyre four years old why shouldnt you shh keep it down youre not supposed to be inside the castle walls i thought you were supposed to be an important person around here important enough for the likes of you youre not the only nobleman in my life you know i never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat who the imp id call him half a nobleman jealous why should i be jealous anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night whats a dwarf like down below ive always wondered might surprise you  hmm hes good with his fingers too and his tongue generous tipper i guess gold is cheap for a lannister no he was a fine man your father you are jealous im a greyjoy weve been lords of the iron islands for  years theres not a family in westeros that can look down on us not even the lannisters and what about the starks ive been lord starks ward since i was eight years old a ward  thats a nice word for it your father rebelled against king robert and if he does it again my father fought for the freedom of his people what the mad king did to him was a terrible crime what did your father do fucked a cook and whelped a whore youre a very serious boy im not a boy  oh yes you are a serious boy with a serious cock i dont want to pay for it then get yourself a wife come on im not gonna hurt you how is your son my lord hell never walk again and that lad but his mind is sound so they say a blessing then i suffered an early mutilation myself some doors close forever others open in most unexpected places may i if the wrong ears heard what im about to tell you off comes my head and who would mourn poor varys then he was a squire until a few months ago north or south they sing no songs for spiders but there are things you must know you are the kings hand and the king is a fool your friend i know but a fool  and doomed unless you save him ive been in the capital a month why have you waited so long to tell me this i didnt trust you so why do you trust me now the queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely there are few men of honour in the capital how could he afford a new suit of armour you are one of them i would like to believe i am another strange as that may seem what sort of doom does the king face the same sort as jon arryn the tears of lys they call it a rare and costly thing as clear and tasteless as water it leaves no trace who gave it to him some dear friend no doubt but which one there were many lord arryn was a kind and trusting man perhaps lord arryn left him some money there was one boy all he was he owed to jon arryn the squire ser hugh pity what happened to him just when his life seemed to be going so nicely if ser hugh poisoned him who paid ser hugh someone who could afford it  jon was a man of peace he was hand for  years   good years why kill him i hear the king wants to joust today  yes that will never happen he started asking questions hes found one bastard already he has the book the rest will come and when he knows the truth what will he do the gods alone know the fools tried to kill his son whats worse  they botched it the wolf and the lion will be at each others throats we will be at war soon my friend   what good is war now robert tends to do what he wants were not ready if one hand can die why not a second this hand is not the other we need time khal drogo will not make his move until his son is born you know what these savages are  delay you say move fast i reply this is no longer a game for two players it never was the first to arrive and the last to leave if the king got what he wanted all the time i admire your industry you do move quietly we all have our qualities you look a bit lonely today you should pay a visit to my brothel this evening first boy is on the house  i think youre mistaking business with pleasure  am i all those birds that whisper in your ear  such pretty little things trust me we accommodate all inclinations hed still be fighting a damned rebellion oh im sure lord redwyne likes his boys very young i hear im a purveyor of beauty and discretion  both equally important though i suppose beauty is a subjective quality no is it true that ser marlon of tumblestone prefers amputees all desires are valid to a man with a full purse and i heard the most awful rumour about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination the logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot i stood vigil for him myself last night its made too small your grace it wont go strictly speaking such a thing would not be in accordance with the kings laws strictly speaking tell me does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box ive often wondered do you know i have no idea where they are and we had been so close but enough about me how have you been since we last saw each other since you last saw me or since i last saw you now the last time i saw you you were talking to the hand of the king your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse saw me with your own eyes  eyes i own council business we all have so much to discuss with ned stark everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for lord starks wife if the lannisters were behind the attempt on the stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen one shudders at the thought  ooh but you know something i do believe that i have seen you even more recently than you have seen me did you know that have you  yes earlier today i distinctly recall seeing you talking to lord stark in his chambers was that you under the bed and not long after that when i saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary council business of course you would have friends from across the narrow sea youre from there yourself after all look at this idiot one ball and no brains were friends arent we lord varys id like to think we are so you can imagine my burden wondering if the king might question my friends sympathies to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend turning right loyalty to the realm oh please  to find myself in a position where a simple word to the king what are you two conspiring about well whatever it is youd best hurry up he cant even put a mans armour on him properly my brother is coming  to a small council meeting disturbing news from far away hadnt you heard off with you no begging im not a beggar i live here dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing i want to see my father i want to fuck the queen for all the good it does me you want your father boy hes lying on the floor of some tavern getting pissed on by his friends youre too fat for your armour  fat my father is hand of the king im not a boy im

small council chamber a meeting has been called i need to see the king first  alone the king is at the small council meeting my lord he has summoned you is it about my wife  no my lord i believe it concerns daenerys targaryen the whore is pregnant  youre speaking of murdering a child youre torturing the poor boy i warned you this would happen back in the north i warned you but you didnt care to hear well hear it now i want em dead mother and child both and that fool viserys as well is that plain enough for you i want them both dead you will dishonour yourself forever if you do this honour ive got seven kingdoms to rule one king seven kingdoms do you think honour keeps them in line you heard the hand the kings too fat for his armour do you think its honour thats keeping the peace its fear  fear and blood  then were no better than the mad king careful ned careful now  you want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumour no rumour my lord the princess is with child based on whose information  ser jorah mormont he is serving as advisor to the targaryens mormont you bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact jorah mormonts a slaver not a traitor go find the breastplate stretcher  now small difference i know to an honourable man he broke the law betrayed his family fled our land we commit murder on the word of this man and if hes right if she has a son a targaryen at the head of a dothraki army what then  the narrow sea still lies between us ill fear the dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water do nothing thats your wise advice do nothing till our enemies are on our shores the breastplate stretcher youre my council counsel speak sense to this honourable fool i understand your misgivings my lord truly i do it is a terrible thing we must consider a vile thing yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm should the gods grant daenerys a son the realm will bleed  i bear this girl no ill will how long before he figures it out but should the dothraki invade how many innocents will die how many towns will burn is it not wiser kinder even that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live we should have had them both killed years ago when you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman best close your eyes get it over with cut her throat be done with it i followed you into war twice maybe you should have one invented  all right all right without doubts without second thoughts but i will not follow you now the robert i grew up with didnt tremble at the shadow of

maybe you should find a little boy i want you my brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war isnt a man he treats me as if im a spoilt child oh and youre not aye loras tyrell the knight of the flowers how many wars have you fought in oh and how much did your father spend on that armour of yours hold still all i ever hear from robert and stannis is how im not tough enough how i squirm at the sight of blood you did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the melee his eye was dangling out of the damn socket he shouldnt have entered the melee if he didnt know how to fight easy for you to say not everyone is such a gifted swordsman drink  im not thirsty its not a gift no one gave it to me im good because i work at it every day of my life since i could hold a stick i could work at fighting all day every day id still never be as good as you yes well i guess well never know everywhere  everywhere so how did it end up the targaryen girl will die  it needs to be done unpleasant as it is roberts rather tasteless about it every time he talks about killing her i swear the table rises six inches drink your king commands it its a shame he cant muster the same enthusiasm for his wife he does have a deep abiding lust for her money you have to give it to the lannisters  they may be the most pompous ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world but they do have outrageous amounts of money i have an outrageous amount of money  not as much as the lannisters but a lot more than you roberts threatening to take me hunting with him last time we were out there for two weeks tramping through the trees in the rain day after day gods all so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh oh but robert loves his killing and hes the king  hmm how did that ever happen  because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it do you know who should be king be serious  i am my father could be your bank ive never fought in a war before but id fight for you  im fourth in line too fat for my armour and wheres robert in the line of royal succession joffrey is a monster tommen is eight stannis  stannis has the personality of a lobster hes still my older brother what are you doing  look at it you cut me  its just blood weve all got it in us sometimes a little spills if you become king youre going to see a lot of this you need to get used to it go on look your squire  a lannister boy people love you they love to serve you because youre kind to them they want to be near you youre willing to do what needs to be done but you dont gloat over it you dont love killing where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst that thrones are only made for the hated and the feared you would be a wonderful king im sorry your marriage to ned stark didnt work out bad luck for him  going against the mountain mm a bloody idiot you seemed so good together im glad i could do something to make you happy without a hand everything will fall to pieces i suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother jaime no hes not serious enough ill say this for ned stark  hes serious enough hmm was it really worth it losing him this way i dont know but cersei insisted but i do know this if the targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the dothraki horde crosses the narrow sea we wont be able to stop them the dothraki dont sail every child knows that they dont have discipline they dont have armour they dont have siege weapons  its a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out is my father wrong lets say viserys targaryen lands i have jon arryn to thank for her with  dothraki screamers at his back we hole up in our castles a wise move only a fool would meet the dothraki in an open field they leave us in our castles they go from town to town looting and burning killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall stealing all our crops and livestock enslaving all our women and children how long do the people of the seven kingdoms stand behind cersei lannister will make a good match he told me their absentee king their cowardly king hiding behind high walls when do the people decide that viserys targaryen is the rightful monarch after all we still outnumber them which is the bigger number  five or one five five one one army  a real army youll need her father on your side united behind one leader with one purpose our purpose died with the mad king now weve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse and everybody wants something different your father wants to own the world ned stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow what do you want we havent had a real fight in nine years backstabbing doesnt prepare you for a fight i thought being king meant i could do whatever i wanted and thats all the realm is now backstabbing and scheming and arselicking and moneygrubbing sometimes i dont know what holds it together our marriage ah so here we sit years later holding it all together dont you get tired every day how long can hate hold a thing together enough of this lets go watch em ride well  years is quite a long time yes it is yes it is what was she like youve never asked about her not once why not at first just saying her name even in private felt like i was breathing life back into her i thought if i didnt talk about her shed just fade away for you when i realised that wasnt going to happen at least i can smell someone elses blood i refused to ask out of spite i didnt want to give you the satisfaction of thinking i cared enough to ask and eventually it became clear that my spite didnt mean anything to you as far as i could tell you actually enjoyed it so why now what harm could lyanna starks ghost do to either of us that we havent done to each other a hundred times over you want to know the horrible truth i cant even remember what she looked like i only know she was the one thing i ever wanted robert  what someone took her away from me and seven kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind i felt something for you once you know i know even after we lost our first boy for quite a while actually was it ever possible for us was there ever a time ever a moment no does that make you feel better or worse it doesnt make me feel anything oh she looks like him dont she my lord she has his nose his black hair aye tell him when you see him my lord if it please you tell him how beautiful she is i will  and tell him ive been with no one else i swear it my lord by the old gods and new i dont want no jewels or nothing just him who determines the draw an inspiring sight for the people eh the king was always good to me when jon arryn came to visit you what did he want  he wasnt that sort of man my lord he just wanted to know if the child was happy healthy looks healthy enough to me the girl shall want for nothing brothels make a much better investment than ships ive found whores rarely sink come bow before your king bow you shits what do you know of king roberts bastards well he has more than you for a start how many  does it matter if you fuck enough women some of them will give you presents and jon arryn tracked them all down why he was the kings hand perhaps robert wanted them looked after he was overcome with fatherly love come jory  my lord such a small pack of wolves wheres arya  at her dancing

who the lannisters are i am a lannister that was not tyrion son of tywin and of course you have also heard the phrase a lannister always pays his debts if you deliver a message from me to lady arryn i will be in your debt i will owe you gold if you deliver the message and i live which i very much intend to do what message tell her i wish to confess my crimes that was not kingly you wish to confess

beyond counting i have lied and cheated gambled and whored if we dont act im not particularly good at violence but im good at convincing others to do violence for me you want specifics i suppose when i was seven i saw a servant girl bathing in the river i stole her robe she was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears if i close my eyes i can still see her tits bouncing when i was  i stuffed my uncles boots with goatshit when confronted with my crime i blamed a squire poor boy was flogged and i escaped justice there will be a war when i was  i milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew i flogged the oneeyed snake i skinned my sausage i made the bald man cry into the turtle stew which i do believe my sister ate at least i hope she did i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel silence what happened next what do you think youre doing so tell your wife to return that little shit of an imp to kings landing confessing my crimes lord tyrion you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder my sisters husband lord jon arryn the hand of the king oh im very sorry i dont know anything about all that youve had your little joke i trust you enjoyed it mord take him back to the dungeon but this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor shes had her fun now put an end to it is this how justice is done in the vale you accuse me of crimes i deny them so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve where is the kings justice i am accused and demand a trial if youre tried and found guilty then by the kings own laws you will pay with your life i understand the law we have no executioner in the eyrie life is more elegant here you hear me send a raven and put an end to it open the moon door you want a trial my lord lannister very well my son will listen to whatever you have to say and you will hear his judgment then you will leave by one door or the other no need to bother lord robin i demand a

your lord husband let me avenge his death ill fight for you my lady  itll be my honour the honour should be mine  make the bad man fly ser vardis youre quiet dont you want to avenge my husband what about jaime with all my heart my lady but the imp is half my size it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice agreed you demanded a trial by combat now i demand a champion i have that right same as you my lady i will gladly fight the imps champion for you i wouldnt be too glad ser i name my brother jaime lannister im half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father the kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here send a raven for him im happy to wait the trial will be today do i have a volunteer anyone anyone i think we can assume that no one is willing ill stand for the dwarf more wine your grace what was i saying   simpler time i dont know what happened between you and those yellowhaired shits it was it was youre too young to remember wasnt it simpler selmy it was your grace  the enemy was right there in the open vicious as you like all but sending you a bloody invitation nothing like today it sounds exhilarating  exhilarating yes not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw you ever fuck a riverlands girl once i think you think i think youd remember i dont want to know this is what matters back in our day you werent a real man until youd fucked one girl from each of the seven kingdoms and the riverlands we used to call it making the eight  those were some lucky girls you ever make the eight barristan i dont believe so your grace those were the days which days exactly the ones where half of westeros fought the other half and millions died or before that when the mad king slaughtered women and babies i cant rule the kingdoms if the starks and the lannisters because the voices in his head told him they deserved it or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground easy boy you might be my brother but youre speaking to the king i suppose it was all rather heroic if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight more wine your grace they burned most everything in the riverlands our fields our granaries are at each others throats so enough our homes they took our women then they took em again when they was done they butchered them as if they was animals they covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire brigands most likely they werent thieves they didnt steal nothing they even left something behind your grace its the kings hand youre addressing not the king the king is hunting as you command your grace fish the sigil of house tully isnt that your wifes house  tully  my lord hand these men were they flying a sigil a banner  none your hand the one who was leading them taller by a foot than any man ive ever met saw him cut the blacksmith in two saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword that sounds like someone we know the mountain with your leave youre describing ser gregor clegane why should ser gregor turn brigand the man is an anointed knight ive heard him called tywin lannisters mad dog im sure you have as well can you think of any reason the lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife if the lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the kings protection it would be  that would be almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital i will return to winterfell and set matters straight well i cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life but perhaps i can give you justice in the name of our king robert lord beric dondarrion you shall have the command assemble  men and ride to ser gregors keep as you command in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm she did nothing i did not command  whod have thought she had it in her piss on that send a raven i want you to stay i charge you to bring the kings justice to the false knight gregor clegane and all those who shared in his crimes i denounce him and attaint him i strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death my lord this this is a drastic action it would be better to wait for king roberts return grand maester pycelle  my lord send a raven to casterly rock im the king i get what i want inform tywin lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen he will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm a bold move my lord and admirable but is it wise to yank the lions tail tywin lannister is the richest man in all the seven kingdoms gold wins wars not soldiers then how come robert is king and not tywin lannister fight i never loved my brothers hold attack attack  come on ser vardis attack stand and fight coward yes enough ser vardis finish him what are you doing get up get up get up get up raise your sword raise it get up man a sad thing for a man to admit but its true on your feet  get up get up and

will follow you and what of my wrath lord stark catelyn stark took my brother you should have taken the realm for yourself jaime told me about the day kings landing fell he was sitting in the iron throne and you made him give it up all you needed to do was climb the steps yourself such a sad mistake ive made many mistakes in my life but that wasnt one of them oh but it was when you play the

love for many years most of my life really play with her arse and she loved me too i was her little confidant her plaything she could tell me anything anything at all it wouldnt have been clean she told me about all the horses that she liked the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry a northerner with a jaw like an anvil so i challenged him to a duel i mean why not id read all the stories the little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories in the end she wouldnt even let him kill me hes just a boy she said please dont hurt him clean so he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by and off they went is she still married to him oh no he got himself killed before the wedding and she ended up with his brother an even more impressive specimen she loves him im afraid and why wouldnt she i mean who could compare to him hes just so good do you know what i learned losing that duel i learned that ill never win not that way you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you thats their game their rules im not going to fight them im going to fuck them thats what i know thats what i am and only by admitting what we are can we get what we want and what do you want oh everything my dear everything there is now wash yourselves both of you are working tonight of your bannerman gregor clegane the mountain er i could care less what anyone thinks of me hmm youre a very lucky girl do you know that where i come from we dont show mercy to criminals where i come from if someone like you attacked a little lord at low tide

boy up and pick their teeth with his bones why did you come here didnt mean to come here meant to get much further south than this as far south as south goes of course it bothers me before the long night comes why what are you afraid of theres things that sleep in the day and hunt at night owls and shadowcats  im not talking about owls and shadowcats the things you speak of theyve been gone for thousands of years they wasnt gone old man they was sleeping and they aint sleeping no more i miss girls a lion doesnt concern himself not even talking to them i never talked to them just looking at

kings own skin his squire the lannister boy such a dutiful boy to make sure his grace did not lack refreshment i do hope the poor lad does not blame himself his grace has had a change of heart concerning daenerys targaryen whatever arrangements you made unmake them at once im afraid those birds have flown i didnt realise you placed such a high value on my brothers life the girl is likely dead already the stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs according to the prophecy the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth the earth ends at the black salt sea no horse can cross the poison water the earth does not end at the sea there are many dirts beyond the sea the dirt where i was born not dirts lands hes a lannister lands yes there are thousands of ships in the free cities wooden horses that fly across the sea lets speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs its not a chair its a throne throne a chair for a king to sit upon or a queen he might be the lowest of the lannisters but hes one of us a king does not need a chair to sit upon he only needs a horse cant you help me make him understand the dothraki do things in their own time for their own reasons have patience khaleesi we will go home i promise you my brother was a fool i know but he was the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms have i said something funny ser forgive me khaleesi but your ancestor aegon the conqueror didnt seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right and every day that he remains a prisoner he had no right to them he seized them because he could and because he had dragons ah well having a few dragons makes things easier you dont believe it  have you ever seen a dragon khaleesi i believe what my eyes and ears report as for the rest it was  years

and rider than any of you its not fair  fair but family i was singing for a high lord at acorn hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock i pushed him away and he said hed have my hands cut off for stealing their silver so now im here  at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you ill never see my family again ill never be inside a

always wanted to be a ranger i always wanted to be a wizard what no im serious so youll stay and say your words with me lord stark a moment alone if you will he named you protector of the realm he did youre blessed with abilities that few men possess she wont care give me an hour and i can put a hundred swords at your command and what should i do with a hundred swords strike tonight while the castle sleeps we must get joffrey away from his mother and into our custody protector of the realm or no he who holds the king holds the kingdom every moment you delay gives cersei another moment to prepare by the time robert dies it will be too late for the both of us what about stannis saving the seven kingdoms from cersei and delivering them to stannis youre blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms you have odd notions about protecting the realm stannis is your older brother this isnt about the bloody line of succession that didnt matter when you rebelled against the mad king it shouldnt matter now whats best for the kingdoms whats best for the people we rule we all know what stannis is he inspires no love or loyalty hes not a king i am and youre still blessed with youth stannis is a commander hes led men into war twice he destroyed the greyjoy fleet yes hes a good soldier everyone knows that so was robert tell me something do you still believe good soldiers make good kings i will not dishonour roberts last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds you will sail to dragonstone tonight you will place this in the hand of stannis baratheon attacking him was stupid and what have you done with these blessings huh not his steward not his captain of the guard and not his wife only stannis himself yes my lord now leave us my lord protector the king has no trueborn sons joffrey and tommen are jaime lannisters bastards youve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings so when the king dies  the throne passes to his brother lord stannis so it would seem unless  there is no unless he is the rightful heir nothing can change that and he cannot take the throne without your help you would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure joffrey succeeds do you have a shred of honour you are now hand of the king and protector of the realm all of the power is yours you need only one a madman the other a drunk reach out and take it make peace with the lannisters release the imp wed your daughter to joffrey weve plenty of time to get rid of stannis and if joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne we simply reveal his little secret and seat lord renly there instead  we youll need someone to share these burdens i assure you my price would be modest what you suggest is treason the future of our family will be determined in these next few months only if we lose make peace with the lannisters you say with the people who tried to murder my boy we only make peace with our enemies my lord thats why its called making peace no i wont do it so it will be stannis and war there is no other choice he is the heir so why did you call me here we could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years not for my wisdom clearly you promised catelyn you would help me the queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard i need the gold cloaks the city watch is  strong and sworn to defend the kings peace look at you you know what you want me to do you know it has to be done or we could collapse into nothing as the targaryens did but its not honourable so the words stick in your throat when the queen proclaims one king and the hand proclaims another whose peace do the gold cloaks protect who do they follow the man who pays them hear my words and bear witness to my vow night gathers and now my watch begins it shall not end until my death i need you to become the man you were always meant to be i shall take no wife hold no lands father no children i shall wear no crowns and win no glory i shall live and die at my post i am the sword in the darkness i am the watcher on the walls i am the shield that guards the realms of men i pledge my life and honour to the nights watch for this night and all the nights to come you knelt as boys not next year not tomorrow rise now as men of the nights watch well done well done whats he got there to me ghost bring it here gods be good what will they do to him when the khalasar rides hell be leashed to a saddle and forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can and when he falls i saw a man last nine miles once now king robert still wants me dead this poisoner was the first he wont be the last i thought hed leave me alone now that my brother is gone he will never leave you alone if you ride to darkest asshai his assassins will follow you if you sailed all the way to the basilisk isles his spies would tell him he will never abandon the hunt youre a targaryen  the last targaryen your son will have targaryen blood youre in pain with  riders behind him he will not have my son he will not have you either khaleesi moon of my life are you hurt jorah the andal i heard what you did choose any horse you wish it is yours i make this gift to you and to my son the stallion who will mount the world lannisters ive had worse my lady i will also pledge a gift i will give him the iron chair that his mothers father sat upon i will give him seven kingdoms i drogo will do this i will take my khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before i will kill the men in iron suits and tear down their stone houses perhaps its time to go home i will rape their women take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to vaes dothrak this i vow i drogo son of bharbo i swear before the mother of mountains as the stars look down in witness as the stars look down in witness lord stark stop   no all right the south doesnt seem to agree with you its all right let him through lord stark king joffrey and the queen regent request your presence in the throne room king joffrey king robert is gone the gods give him rest all is accomplished the city watch is yours good is lord renly joining us i fear lord renly has left the city he rode through the old gate an hour before dawn i

seal  unbroken lord eddard stark is herein named protector of the realm to rule as regent until the heir come of age is that why you called me here to pose me riddles may i see that letter ser barristan protector of the realm is this meant to be your shield lord stark a piece of paper those were the kings words  we have a new king now lord eddard when we last spoke you offered me some counsel allow me to return the courtesy bend the knee my lord bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days has he done this before in the grey waste you call home your son has no claim to the throne liar you condemn yourself with your own mouth lord stark ser barristan seize this traitor ser barristan is a good man a loyal man do him no harm you think he stands alone kill him kill all of them i command it commander take the queen and her children into custody escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there under guard jaime would have killed him my brother is worth a thousand of your friend men of the watch i want no bloodshed tell your men to lay down their swords no one needs to die now i did warn you not to trust me your brother or your lover dont act like fools the targaryens wed brothers and sisters for  years to keep bloodlines pure jaime and i are more than brother and sister we shared a womb we came into this world together we belong together my son saw you with him do you love your children with all my heart  no more than i love mine and theyre all jaimes   thank the gods in the rare event that robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed are you going to say something clever i finish him off in other ways in the morning he doesnt remember  youve always hated him hated him i worshipped him every girl in the seven kingdoms dreamed of him but he was mine by oath and when i finally saw him on our wedding day in the sept of baelor lean and fierce and blackbearded it was the happiest moment of my life that night he crawled on top of me stinking of wine and did what he did what little he could do and whispered in my ear lyanna ,5009

pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy he wasnt himself otherwise he never would have said it a childs faith such sweet innocence and yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes treason is treason anything else and sansa  still engaged to joffrey if you still have any affection in your heart for me please do me this kindness your grace your sweet words have moved me but your father has to confess he has to confess and say that im the king or therell be no mercy for him he will cersei will keep her close the rest of your household though all dead it grieves me to say i do so hate the sight of blood you watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing shes with her dancing master shes with him every morning and would again my lord i was unarmed unarmoured and surrounded by lannister swords when you look at me do you see a hero what madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about joffreys birth the madness of mercy that she might save her children  ah the children its always the innocents who suffer it wasnt the wine that killed robert nor the boar the wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open she always comes back with scrapes and bruises shes so clumsy but it was your mercy that killed the king i trust you know youre a dead man lord eddard the queen cant kill me cat holds her brother the wrong brother sadly and lost to her your wife has let the imp slip through her fingers if thats true then slit my throat and be done with it not today my lord tell me something varys who do you truly serve hush the realm my lord someone must its othor without a doubt the other one is jafer flowers my lord less the hand the wolf tore off any sign of benjen or the rest of his party just these two my lord been dead awhile id say mmm  the smell

8,9,9.6,1,youve seen better days my lord ive given up trying to guess oh  you too you see that fifteen she is a little flower and her honeys all mine im sure she will give you many sons huh your father didnt come to the wedding he is quite ill my lord huh didnt come to the last one either or the one before that when i was still a boy your family has always pissed on me my lord i  dont deny it you know its true the fine lord tully would never marry any of his children to mine im sure there were reasons  i didnt need reasons i needed to get rid of sons and daughters you see how they pile up why are you here to ask you to open your gates my lord so my son and his bannermen may cross the trident and be on their way why should i let him  if you could climb your own battlements before they cut my balls off with a hot knife you would see that he has  men outside your walls theyll be  corpses when tywin lannister gets here dont try and frighten me lady stark your husbands in a cell beneath the red keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm you swore an oath to my father oh yes i said some words and i swore oaths to the crown too if i remember right joffreys king now which makes your boy and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels it seems to me i travelled with a group of actors through the free cities if i had the sense the gods gave a fish id hand you both over to the lannisters why dont you  stark tully lannister baratheon give me one good reason why i should waste a single thought on any of you and engage when does aemon think youll be able to use that hand soon he says  good youll be ready for this then i thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so i had a new pommel made its called longclaw works as well for a wolf as a bear i think they taught me that each man has a role to play this is valyrian steel it was my fathers sword his father before him the mormonts have carried it for five centuries it was meant for my son jorah he brought dishonour to our house but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from westeros my lord you honour me but i cant  oh you can and you will i wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for you and your beast a bloody dead man tried to kill me the same is true at court so youll take it ill hear no more about it is that understood  yes my lord right now dont think this means i approve of this nonsense with you and alliser thorne thats a mans sword itll take a man to wield it ill apologise to ser alliser tonight no you wont i sent him to kings landing yesterday the hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist ive uh ordered thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king i am the master of whisperers that should get young joffreys attention and it uh puts a thousand leagues between you and thorne now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper yes my lord well done  well done you earned that snow well done go on lets have a look at what   the sword show us the sword my role is to be sly obsequious and without scruples sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword lets have a look  piss off come on i want to have a look at it in the light give it here what is it i  look at its eyes give it  i cant you cant what i im a good actor my lord im really not supposed to say and yet you really want to say you want to say that there was a raven i read the message to maester aemon its your brother robb what what about him hes heading south to war huh can you free me from this pit all his bannermen have rallied to his side theyll keep him safe i should be there i should be with him if we do that theyll never get back across well what did he say lord walder has granted your crossing his men are yours as well   huh less the  he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you what does he want in return another visit i could you will be taking on his son olyvar as your personal squire he expects a knighthood in good time  fine fine and and arya will marry his son waldron when they both come of age she wont be happy about that  hm and and when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters but will i whichever you prefer he has a number he thinks will be suitable i see did you get a look at his daughters i did and one was do you consent can i refuse  not if you want to cross then i consent no sam said you wanted to see me i did indeed perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me tell me did you ever wonder why the men of the nights watch take no wives and father no children no so they will not love love is the death of duty if the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honour on the one hand as i said im no hero and those he loves on the other what would he do he he would do whatever was right no matter what then lord stark is one man in most of us are not so strong what is honour compared to a womans love and what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or a brothers smile what do you want tell me sam told you were all human oh we all do our duty when theres no cost to it honour comes easy then yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose and this is my day no riddles no stories tell me what do you want is that what youre saying oh it hurts boy oh yes i know  you do not know no one knows i may be a bastard but he is my father and robb is my brother the gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows they waited till i was old what could i do when the ravens brought the news from the south the ruin of my house the death of my family peace i was helpless blind frail but when i heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children even the little children who are you my father was maekar the first of his name did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen loyal lad my brother aegon reigned after him when i had refused the throne and he was followed by his son aerys whom they called the mad king youre aemon targaryen im a maester of the citadel bound in service to castle black and the nights watch i will not tell you to stay or go you must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days fighting for his fathers freedom as i have my lord my sun and stars drogo my horse blood of my blood no i must ride he fell from his horse a khal who cannot ride is no khal hes tired thats all he needs to rest robb weve ridden far enough today well camp here this is no place to camp a woman does not give us orders not even a khaleesi well camp here tell them khal drogo commanded it you do not command me khaleesi find mirri maz duur bring her to me the witch ill bring you her head khaleesi bring her to me unharmed or khal drogo will hear why you denied me hyah hyah our scouts tell us the stark host has moved south from the twins it seems youre my last friend hes just a boy with lord freys levies in tow theyre a days march north the boy may lack experience and sense but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage  ah oh do continue didnt mean to interrupt i do hope your savages are going to be of some use otherwise weve wasted good steel on them the great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes heavy black steel doublesided boys have been conquerors before shagga likes axes when the battle commences you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard the vanguard  mmhm me and the tribesmen on the front lines they do seem rather ferocious ferocious last night a moon brother stabbed a stone crow over a sausage three stone crows seized the moon brother and opened his throat bronn managed to keep shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock which was fortunate but even still ulf is demanding blood money but the man giving cersei sleepless nights is the kings the late kings brother which shagga and gunthor refuse to pay when soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their commander surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort therell be no more discussion on the matter it appears im not hungry after all excuse me my lords where did you find one so pretty at this hour i took her  took her from whom  from uh ser whats his name lord stannis has the best claim to the throne i dont know ginger cunt three tents

the fire is burning your pretty soft skin ah damn you woman are you immune to pain just used to it  drink lets play a new game theres a braavosi knife game i could teach you does it involve the potential for losing fingers not if you win  no no fire games no knife games cersei knows you as a man of honour lets do something im good at  what are you good at i happen to be a great judge of character this sounds like a boring game  its not heres how it works  i make a statement about your past if im right you drink if im wrong i drink and no lying ill know if youre lying i dont want to play this game fine bronn first your father beat you but my mother hit harder if you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave you killed your first man before you were it was a woman she swung an axe at me youve been north of the wall what brought you up there work  and you once loved a woman many years ago but it turned out badly so youve never let yourself love again oh wait thats me your turn my mysterious foreign beauty i believe she will allow you to take the black i dont want to play its fun look at the fun were having your mother was a whore drink all right your father left the family when you were very young never to return drink and weve established the rules about lying  drink mm you wanted a different life and live out your days on the wall with your brother and your bastard son you came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere the whole shitstained world could drink off that one so specifics you wanted to be elsewhere but how would you get there i dont believe the life of the silent sisters is for you so whats a lowborn girl to do drink are you sure  drink and dont talk about my mother and father ever or i will carve your eyes from your head you think my life is some precious thing to me my dear lady if i have offended you i apologise my turn fine fine ask away try to penetrate the enigma that is me who were you in love with  thats not how the game works i dont care the way the game works our lord here used to be married married  how did you hear that you hear lots of things playing dice with lannister soldiers sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life that i would trade my honour for a few more years of another night perhaps not another night this night its not a pleasant story oh maybe i will cry im guessing the lady and i can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship so i was  my brother jaime and i were riding when we heard a scream she ran out onto the road clothes half torn off with two men on her heels jaime scared away the men easily enough while i wrapped her in my cloak she was too scared to send off on her own of what so while jaime hunted down the rapers i took her to the nearest inn and fed her her name was tysha she was a wheelwrights orphan and she was hungry together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine impossible as it seems there was a time when i was unaccustomed to wine i forgot how afraid i was around girls how i was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother you grew up with actors i forgot about everything but tysha and somehow i found myself in her bed for three chickens i should hope so it didnt last long i didnt know what the hell i was doing but she was good to me she kissed me afterwards and sang me a song and by morning i was deep enough in love to ask for her hand a few lies a few gold coins one drunken septon and there you have it  man and wife you learned their craft and you learnt it well for a fortnight anyway until the septon sobered up and told my father well i imagine that was the end of all that not quite first my father had jaime tell me the truth the girl was a whore you see jaime had arranged the whole thing  the road the rapers all of it he thought it was time i had a woman after my brother confessed my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards but i grew up with soldiers he paid her well  a silver for each man how many whores command that kind of price he brought me into the barracks and made me watch by the end she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor i would have killed the man who did that to me you should have known she was a whore really i was  drunk and in love a girl who was almost raped doesnt invite another man into her bed two hours later i learned how to die a long time ago as i said i was young and stupid you are still young and stupid hyah what is it what do you want  youre sleeping through the war what  they stole a nights march on us theyre a mile north get my squire  you dont have a squire if i die weep for me youll be dead how will

hes roberts youngest brother if bran cant be lord of winterfell before me renly cant be king before stannis do you mean to declare us for stannis renly is not right   my lords if we put ourselves behind stannis  my lords here is what i say to these two kings renly baratheon is nothing to me youre afraid just like hodor  im not afraid of some hole in the ground nor stannis neither why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the south what do they know of the wall or the wolfswood even their gods are wrong why shouldnt we rule ourselves again it was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead there sits the only king i mean to bend my knee to the king in the north ill have peace on those terms youve lived beyond the wall what are you scared of they can keep their red castle and their iron chair too the king in the north am i your brother now and always now and always my sword is yours in victory and defeat from this day until my last day the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north im a crippled boy and im willing to go the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north lady stark  i want to see him now leave us you look lovely tonight lady stark thats my grandfather lord rickard widowhood becomes you your bed must be lonely is that why you came im not at my best but i think i could be of service you slip out of that gown and well see if im up to it oh i do like a violent woman i will kill you tonight ser pack your head in a box and send it to your sister let me show you how hit me again over the ear he was burned alive by the mad king aerys and again and again youre stronger than you look it shouldnt take long that is what you want the world to believe isnt it that you dont fear death but i dont my lady the dark is coming for all of us why cry about it because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just  what gods are those the trees your husband prayed to where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off if your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice thats lyanna my fathers sister because of men like you there are no men like me only me my son bran how did he come to fall from that tower i pushed him out the window why i hoped the fall would kill him why you should get some sleep do you remember me now boy eh king robert was supposed to marry her its going to be a long war i cant believe were actually at war was it this exciting last time when you were young what does it say have we captured robb stark yet whats our next move  stop talking get back into bed they have my son the stark boy appears to be less green than wed hoped ive heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses but rhaegar targaryen kidnapped her is it true about stannis and renly both baratheon brothers have taken up against us jaime captured his armies scattered its a catastrophe perhaps we should sue for peace theres your peace joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove ned starks head youll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing robb stark to the table now hes winning robert started a war to win her back in case you hadnt noticed  im told we still have his sisters the first order of business is ransoming ser jaime no truces we cant afford to look weak we should march on them at once first we must return to casterly rock to raise they have my son get out all of you not you you were right about eddard stark if he were alive we could have used him to broker a peace with winterfell and riverrun which would have given us more time to deal with roberts brothers but now he killed rhaegar but she died anyway madness madness and stupidity i always thought you were a stunted fool perhaps i was wrong half wrong im new to strategy but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies it appears we cant stay here no one will stay here ser gregor will head out with  riders and set the riverland on fire from gods eye to the red fork the rest of us will regroup at harrenhal thats where i saw father and you will go to kings landing and do what  rule you will serve as hand of the king in my stead you will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too if needs be and if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest baelish varys pycelle  heads spikes walls why not my uncle why not anyone why me youre my son oh one more thing you see hes not here you will not take that whore to court do you understand ser jorah gently gently my son where is he i want him where is he the boy did not live tell me  what is there to tell how did my son die here shaggydog   rickon he never lived my princess the women say what do the women say they say the child was   monstrous twisted i pulled him out myself he was scaled like a lizard blind with leather wings like the wings of a bat when i touched him the skin fell from his bones inside he was full of graveworms i warned you that only death can pay for life that beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels you knew the price where is khal drogo show him to me show me what i bought with my sons life as you command lady come i will take you to him time enough for that later  i want to see him now the khalasar is gone a khal who cannot ride is no khal the dothraki follow only the strong he doesnt like chains  what are you doing down here im sorry my princess drogo my sun and stars why is he out here alone he seems to like the warmth princess he lives you asked for life you paid for life this is not life when will he be as he was when the sun rises in the west sets in the east when the seas go dry when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves come back up with us  no i came to see father leave us i dont want you alone with this sorceress i have nothing more to fear from this woman go you knew what i was buying and you knew the price it was wrong of them to burn my temple it angered the great shepherd  this is not gods work my child was innocent  innocent he would have been the stallion who mounts the world now he will burn no cities now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust remember me theres a bright boy how many times have i told you hes in kings landing with sansa and arya i spoke for you i saved you   saved me three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me girl i saw my gods house burn there where i had healed men and women beyond counting in the streets i saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread the head of a young boy that i had cured of fever just three moons past so tell me again exactly what it was that you saved your life he was down here i saw him why dont you take a look at your khal then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone you cant get out of my way sam theyll put out the word theyll send out ravens people will come after you do you know what happens to deserters better than you do what are you going to do saw him when im gonna find my brother and put a sword through king joffreys throat you cant leave us now we need you here move  i wont let you go move  no hyah hand of the king so it would seem and your father said you couldnt take anyone with you to kings landing no he said i couldnt take you with me to kings landing last night when i was sleeping he was very specific on that point  he knew my name what he said dont bring shae with you to kings landing i believe he used the word whore are you ashamed of me are you afraid that im dancing around the court with my tits out im funny now im shae the funny whore my fathers probably the most powerful man in the country certainly the richest here shaggydog he has all seven kingdoms in his pockets everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says hes always been a cunt i believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you why dont you come with me be the hands lady because the king needs a hand and the hand i know what a hand needs ghost hyah you both miss him hyah hyah hyah samwell is he dead  no hes not dead did we get him come on help me get him up lucky youve got plenty of padding were taking you back to where you belong i belong with my brother  but were your brothers now theyll kill you if they find out youve gone its only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams theyll kill you if they know you came after me go back  sam told us everything were sorry about your father  but it doesnt matter you took the oath you cant leave i have to  you cant you said the words  i dont care about hear my words and bear witness to my vow to hell with all of you  night gathers and now my watch begins it shall not end until my death i shall live and die at my post but that doesnt mean that i am the sword

my sun and stars if you are in there if you havent gone away show me youre a fighter youve always been a fighter i need you to fight now i know youre very far away bran but come back to me my sun and stars when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east then you shall return to me my sun and stars kings oh i can tell you all there is to know about kings the thing you need to understand about kings is for the past  years ive known truly known more kings than any man alive my lady  my lady theyre complicated men but i know how to serve them yes and keep on serving them aerys targaryen of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us madness is the worst he was a good man such a charmer to watch him melt away before my eyes consumed by dreams of fire and blood youll be coming with me boy and youll be keeping your mouth shut my lady robert baratheon was an entirely different animal powerful man great warrior but alas winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things they say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down he can often be blind to the enemies at his side now i serve his son king joffrey may the gods bless his reign my lady he is a capable young man  strong military mind stern but sternness in defence of the realm is no vice its far too soon to know what manner of king he will be but i sense true greatness on the

well sleep beneath a waterfall maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast generally yes but ive sent all the young men off to fight robb starks war king robb and its not his war he didnt choose it maybe not my lord but he called in his banners and took the men joffrey killed my father no no your grace your liege lord do you remember your vows ser of course i remember

fire and that sword shall be lightbringer stannis baratheon warrior of light your sword awaits you lord cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors for the night is dark and full of terror this woman will lead him into a war he cannot win stannis is our king he is a fool youre so clever to see it we follow where he leads even if we dont like the path  king since that boar killed his brother every lord wants a coronation i dont serve the others i serve stannis as do i but loyal service means telling hard truths hes surrounded by fools and fanatics but he trusts you davos if you tell him the truth whats the truth hell make a much better fool than a knight and i declare upon the honour of my house that my beloved brother robert he wasnt my beloved brother i didnt love him he didnt love me a harmless courtesy your grace a lie take it out that my brother robert left no trueborn heirs the boy joffrey the boy tommen and the girl myrcella being born of incest between cersei lannister and her brother jaime lannister by right of birth  jaime lannister the kingslayer call him what he is he doesnt deserve the mercy of a quick death and her brother jaime lannister the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim make it ser jaime lannister the kingslayer whatever else he is the mans still a knight ser jaime lannister the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim to the iron throne of westeros let all true men declare their loyalty when eddard stark learned the truth he told only me ill not make the same mistake did you hear my lady ser dontos send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm from the arbor to the wall the time has come to choose let no man claim ignorance as an excuse your grace the lannisters are the true enemy if for the time being you could make peace with your brother ill not make peace with renly while he calls himself king well many have already declared for him mace tyrell randyll tarly stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support it was well struck your grace from this day youll be my new fool the lord of light stands behind him and how many ships has the lord of light got in his fleet he has no need for ships  im sure he doesnt but we do if were going to war if not renly your grace join forces with robb stark who would steal the northern half of my kingdom ive always served thieves according to their deserts as you well know ser davos joffrey renly robb stark theyre all thieves theyll bend the knee or ill destroy them i owe you an apology my king thank you your grace my duty is to serve you have chosen the new god over the old gods may the lord of light watch over us all shall we drink together dont a cup of wine to honour the one true god the night is dark and full of terrors old man but the fire burns them all away king in the north i keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping and you my lady thank you but you drag me along from camp to camp have you grown fond of me stark is that it ive never seen you with a girl if i left you with one of my bannermen your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message release my son and youll be rich beyond your dreams refuse and your house will be destroyed root and stem you dont trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle beloved nephew oh i trust them with my life just not with yours smart boy whats wrong dont like being called boy insulted you insult yourself kingslayer youve been defeated by a boy youre held captive by a boy perhaps youll be killed by a boy we looked for you on the battlefield stannis baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of westeros king joffrey baratheon is neither a true king nor a true baratheon hes your bastard son if thats true stannis is the rightful king how convenient for him my father learned the truth thats why you had him executed i was your prisoner when ned stark lost his head your son killed him so the world wouldnt learn who fathered him you were nowhere to be found and you you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen you have proof or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives im sending one of your cousins down to kings landing with my peace terms you think my fathers going to negotiate with you you dont know him very well no but hes starting to know me three victories dont make you a conqueror its better than three defeats ive been here ruling the kingdoms this city stinks like dead bodies a bit corpsey yes and shit i thought you wanted to come here i love it you love the smell of dead bodies and shit and cum and garlic and rum you can smell cum from the balcony i love the stink i love the noise what a fine job youve done cities make me want to fuck and so did the country this is where i belong yes well you need to be careful no one can know youre here no one will know you cant trust anyone in kings landing theyre all liars good liars bad liars one or two great liars what about you look at you me im not from here im a slave to the truth truth you are the biggest little liar i have ever met why do you think i am so little im being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth ned stark actually slept on this as if the poor man didnt suffer enough one of the many changes well have to make around here lord baelish your grace more beautiful than ever i wonder if i might ask you for a favour of course your grace ned starks youngest daughter arya we cant seem to locate her if shes escaped the capital winterfell seems the logical destination and yet my friends in the north report no sign of her curious if we choose to negotiate with the starks the girl has some value whoever finds her well you know what they say about lannisters and debts i already said it was well struck and you well you could ask varys where she is hell have an answer for you whether you believe it myself i have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs who knows what they want a mockingbird you created your own sigil didnt you  yes appropriate for a selfmade man with so many songs to sing im glad you like it some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family youre going to be bigger than the hound others have to find their own way i heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family he loved the eldest daughter sadly she had eyes for another when boys and girls live in the same home awkward situations can arise sometimes ive heard even brothers and sisters develop certain affections and when those affections become common knowledge well that is an awkward situation indeed but much better looking especially in a prominent family but prominent families often forget a simple truth ive found and which truth is that knowledge is power seize him cut his throat stop wait ive changed my mind let him go step back three paces this one doesnt like me turn around close your eyes power is power do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me i would very much appreciate it youre ser alton lannister i am your grace i offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms first your family must release my sisters cant imagine why second my fathers bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath winterfell and the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned their families can honour them with proper funerals an honourable request your grace  third joffrey and the queen regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the north from this time till the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom the king in the north king in the north  king in the north neither joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again we heard you were dead  im glad youre not dead if he disregards this command he shall suffer the same fate as my father only i dont need a servant to do my beheading for me these are your grace these are these are my terms if the queen regent and her son meet them ill give them peace if not i will litter the south with lannister dead king joffrey is a baratheon your grace oh is he me too dear death is so boring youll ride at daybreak ser alton that will be all for tonight a word your grace you dont have to call me your grace when no ones around its not so bad once you get used to it im glad someones gotten used to it the lannisters are going to reject your terms you know of course they are we can fight them in the fields as long as you like but we wont beat them until you take kings landing especially now with so much excitement in the world and we cant take kings landing without ships my father has ships and men who know how to sail them men who fought my father men who fought king robert to free themselves from the yoke of the south just like youre doing now im his only living son hell listen to me i know he will im not a stark i know that but your father raised me to be an honourable man we can avenge him together my lady im sorry for your loss you dont want balon greyjoy for an ally i need his ships they say he has they say a million rats live in the sewers of kings landing shall we rally them to fight for us i understand you dont trust lord greyjoy i dont trust lord greyjoy because he is not trustworthy your father had to go to war to end his rebellion yes and now im the one rebelling against the throne before me it was father you married one rebel and mothered another her loss i mothered more than just rebels a fact you seem to have forgotten if i trade the kingslayer for two girls my bannermen will string me up by my feet you want to leave sansa in the queens hands and arya i havent heard a word about arya what are we fighting for if not for them its more complicated than that you know it is its time for me to go home i havent seen bran or rickon in months you cant go to winterfell yes your grace her father was a confessed traitor i beg your pardon ill send rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow youll ride south to the stormlands why in the name of all the gods because i need you to negotiate with renly baratheon hes rallied an army of you know him you know his family i havent seen renly baratheon since he was a boy you have a hundred other lords which of these lords do i trust more than you but still her father if renly sides with us well outnumber them two to one when they feel the jaws beginning to shut theyll sue for peace well get the girls back then well all go home for good i will ride at first light we will all be together again soon i promise youve done so well your father would be proud give lord renly my regards  king renly surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathise theres a king in every corner now what is all this returning this room to its proper appearance say what you will about the targaryens they were conquerors that is a seat for a conqueror it needs a room to match it not vines and flowers we cant find arya stark with luck shes dead in a ditch somewhere perhaps but if not we need her theyll never give jaime back to us for sansa alone my father was a traitor i think they might theyre weak they put too much value on their women we need to set our armies to the task of finding her send out as many men as we can im sure if you asked grandfather the king does not ask he commands and my grandfathers stupidity in the field of battle is the reason robb stark has uncle jaime in the first place his life is in danger were at war my mother and brother are traitors too all our lives are in danger i heard a disgusting lie about uncle jaime and you our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne its not a claim the throne is mine of course it is no one believes this foul gossip someone believes it father had other children besides me and tommen and myrcella i am loyal to my beloved joffrey what are you asking im asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you how many bastards does he have running what you just did is punishable by death you will never do it again never that will be all mother no no no no do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound

your own who said anything about the lannisters youll have your gold when we take the treasury at kings landing or you can go back to your city and tell your masters all these kings fighting for the throne and this stannis has the smallest army why would i bet on the man with the worst chance because youre a smart gambler stannis has proved himself in war twice his baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield neither has the false king joffrey and yet they both have larger armies stannis has just begun the fight his bannermen will rally to his cause you didnt find what you were looking for theres no man in the seven kingdoms more honourable than stannis baratheon or more worthy of loyalty what is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honour of kings mind your words pirate  matthos you think im insulted i am a pirate im an excellent pirate i dont sail for promises of course you do every time you leave harbour youre leaving on a promise what do you want were looking for a boy named gendry a promise that somewhere on the sea somebodys got some gold and you can take it from him thats a promise that always comes true  as is mine youre not a young man salladhor and correct me if im wrong most pirates dont grow old only the clever ones you want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from pentoshi cheesemongers and myrenese silk merchants

with your fleet all  of my ships and if we dont drown at the bottom of blackwater bay i will fuck this blonde queen and ill fuck her well this war isnt about you anyone turning him over will earn the kings reward were not attacking kings landing so that you can rape the queen im not going to rape her im going to fuck her as if she would just let you you dont know how persuasive i am ive never tried to fuck you stannis is the rightful king and the lord of light the one true god ive been all over the world my boy and everywhere i go people tell me about the true gods they all think they found the right one well be back with more men the one true god is whats between a womans legs and better yet a queens legs i never thought youd have a true believer for a son hes young yet i promise

already know the letters my lord the holy books are much more persuasive than i can be i wish i had a god truly im not mocking you but ive seen men pray to every god there is pray for wind pray for rain pray for home none of it works  but you always came home i wasnt praying but i was every night that you were at sea i lit a candle and i prayed for you you want me to have a god you make me wait a long time fine king stannis is my god he raised me up and blessed me with his trust he gave you a future i could never have imagined you know how to read youll be a knight someday you think a fire god commanded all that it was stannis only stannis stannis is my king but hes only a man dont tell him that lord janos slynt was commander of the city watch you had no right to exile him but your friend keeps me company i have every right i am the kings hand youre serving as the kings hand till father gets here i am queen regent listen to me queen regent youre losing the people do you hear me   the people you think i care you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead half the city will starve when winter comes the other half will plot to overthrow you and your goldplated thugs just gave them their rallying cry we were just speaking of your bravery the queen slaughters babies you dont even have the decency to deny it it wasnt you who gave the order was it joffrey didnt even tell you did he tell you i imagine that would be even worse he did what needed to be done you want to be hand of the king you want to rule this is what ruling is lying on a bed of weeds ripping them out by the root one by one in the victory against the stark auxiliary forces before they strangle you in your sleep im no king but i think theres more to ruling than that i dont care what you think youve never taken it seriously you havent jaime hasnt its all fallen on me as has jaime repeatedly according to stannis baratheon youre funny youve always been funny but none of your jokes will ever match the first one will they a man has a thirst it was quite a battle you remember back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death she was my mother too mother gone for the sake of you theres no bigger joke in the world than that your grace  your grace how did you fare with your pirate salladhor saan will join our fleet  ships i heard you suffered a terrible head wound his men know how to fight in my experience pirates prefer fighting unarmed men it does seem the wiser choice there wont be a choice this time do you trust him salladhor saan is an old friend ive known him  years ive never trusted him now once he gets the smell of gold he never stops well if he does his job hell have his share leave us the northerners are such fearsome warriors at once your grace the lord of light shines through you young warrior come what did you say to him i told him death by fire is the purest death why  because it is true youre troubled

brother has  men according to the scouts men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me you must have faith faith in a real war the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten then we must be the th i cannot defeat my brother in the field to find so lovely a creature working in your fathers kitchens and i cant take kings landing without the men hes stolen i have seen the path to victory in the flames but first you must give yourself to the lord of light ive said the words damn you i burned the idols you must give all of yourself i have a wife i took a vow shes sickly weak shut away in a tower it almost beggars belief she disgusts you and shes given you nothing no sons only stillborns only death i will give you a son my king a son strange things do happen you should taste her fish pie

teach you how to do your job do you want me to leave just brush my hair oh thank the gods now ready my horse i havent had a proper shit in six days ive encountered this problem before my lord the stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect two drops with water daily right im so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side please  thank you my lord i can trust you pycelle can i not why yes of course my lord we leave at dawn these are perilous times and the crown must forge new alliances and these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony matrimony huh yes im trusting the council with these plans but the queen mustnt know we cant have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm theres too much at stake oh yes yes indeed yes i shall be silent as the grave dont lose it again im brokering an alliance with house martell of dorne princess myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it myrcella sent away to dorne but remember the queen mustnt know ooh the queen mustnt know i love conversations that begin this way i plan to marry princess myrcella off gilly to theon greyjoy theon greyjoy forgive me my lord but how he grew up a ward of winterfell he fights for robb stark  precisely theons father loathes the starks and will convince the boy to come to our side greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have his fathers ships but remember you must tell no one tell no one what youre leaving i plan to wed princess myrcella to robin arryn of the vale lysa is not fond of me but perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones she imprisoned you she tried to execute you and you offer her son a princess for men in our position holding grudges can be an encumbrance dont you think and i suppose you want me to broker this agreement who better yes i could sing this song to lysa if i cared to i i wanted to give you something whats in it for me the gratitude of the people of westeros for helping to end this war the adoration of the king for bringing the vale back into the fold and harrenhal harrenhal is cursed never took you for a superstitious man by all means tear it down and rebuild youll be able to afford it i plan to make you lord of the riverlands with a single stroke youd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm you served my family well in the matter of the succession it belonged to my mother so did janos slynt and he was given harrenhal too until you snatched it away i need you to deliver lysa arryn i didnt need janos slynt its settled then good oh and remember the queen mustnt know that must hurt what i cant take it  please what is it a member of the kingsguard as if i wasnt humiliated enough already brienne is a very capable warrior and shes devoted to me youre jealous jealous of brienne the beauty dont make me laugh ill make it up to you  no your grace i want you to not tonight theres another tyrell who requires your attention you didnt win my fathers support or his army on charm alone your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back brides arent usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night and margaerys a virgin officially shall i bring her to you i should warn you ive had quite a bit of wine as is your right you are a king gone my mother used it for sewing you look very beautiful thank you your grace its a lovely gown  you think so i cant decide how i like it better this way or this way you certainly dont need it although some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed must be the wine shed let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed here let me im sorry do you want my brother to come in and help what  he could get you started i know he wouldnt mind or i can turn over and you can pretend im him i dont know what youre talking about theres no need for us to play games save your lies for court youre going to need a lot of them your enemies arent happy about us they want to tear us apart and id read to her and the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly we can try again later you decide how you want to do it with me with me and loras however else you like whatever you need to do you are a king you monster myrcella is my only daughter my father put a stop to it when he found out do you really think ill let you sell her like a common whore myrcellas a princess some would say she was born for this i will not let you ship her off to dorne as i was shipped off to robert baratheon dorne is the safest place for her are you mad the martells loathe us thats why we need to seduce them were going to need their support in the war your son started shell be a hostage  a guest you wont get away with this you think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe its the only thing i have of hers ned stark had a piece of paper too its done cersei  no you cannot stop it  no just how safe do you think myrcella is if this city falls do you want to see her raped butchered like the targaryen children make no mistake theyll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours get out get out theon of the house greyjoy you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned god she gave it to me before i left for the wall i would  kneel let theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel what is dead may never die what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger stand you i dont appreciate being made a fool of dwarf if myrcella marries the martell boy she cant very well marry robin arryn can she no afraid not sorry about that and harrenhal i suppose thats off the table as well yes i fear so sorry about that too leave me out of your next deception thats a shame you were to be the centrepiece of my next deception you shouldnt give it away my brother jaime rots in a northern stockade i would see him released thats where you come in robb stark will never release the kingslayer no he wont but his mother might how would you like to see your beloved cat again find him  oh aye and he has company filthy old stoat almost hate to interrupt no you dont no i dont im not giving it away what is the meaning of this no please please you disappoint me grand maester i am your loyal servant so loyal that you told the queen about my plans to send myrcella to dorne no never its a falsehood i swear it it wasnt me ah varys it was varys the spider im giving it to you see i told varys that i was giving the princess to the greyjoys i told littlefinger that i planned to wed her to robin arryn i told no one that i was offering her to the dornish no one but you the eunuch has spies everywhere cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats no no no  there are no goats halfman well make do how long have you been spying for my sister all i did i did for house lannister and you will make this right keep it safe for me always your lord father ask him ive always been his servant since the days of the mad king i dont like his beard  what what no no how many hands have you betrayed pycelle eddard stark jon arryn lord arryn he knew he knew the truth about the queen and he planned to act to tell king robert so you poisoned him till i come back no never but you let him die made sure he succumbed lannister i always served lannister get him out of my sight throw him in one of the black cells no no no no no please dont you cant do this to me for your trouble youll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in lady sansas service good one of my better ideas hodor and it seems the grand maester has found his way into a black cell well played my lord hand but should i be worried janos slynt pycelle the small council grows smaller every day the council has a reputation for serving past hands poorly i dont mean to follow ned stark to the grave power is a curious thing my lord are you fond of riddles why am i about to hear one hodor three great men sit in a room a king a priest and a rich man between them stands a common sellsword each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two who lives who dies depends on the sellsword does it he has neither crown nor gold nor favour with the gods he has a sword the power of life and death but if its

right little prick lord baelish all of these tents look the same to me would you be so kind  it would be my pleasure it took me weeks to learn my way around the camp twice i walked in on officers in stages of undress and the moment i learn which tent is mine were on the move again your tent not our tent the king snores perhaps or simply prefers solitude pressures of command no doubt hes the strongest  bulls are bigger than lions you should see your face four kings vying for the throne i am not tutored in warfare but basic arithmetic favours the side with the greater numbers if war were arithmetic the mathematicians would rule the world i did notice your brother entering his graces tent just now the place of a kingsguard is by the kings side and on the night of your wedding who was by the kings side then you seem quite interested in our marriage your marriage is quite interesting not only to me but to the realm i swear you pissed yourself the marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest if nothing else youve never married have you ive been unlucky in my affections sadly that is sad though perhaps its for the best the whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you so allow me to explain my husband is my king and my king is my husband here is your tent lord baelish good night this isnt your horse oh who goes there ahh it was given to me by the thirteen the elders of qarth qarth three days to the east on the sea will they let us in they said they would be honoured to receive the mother of dragons what do you know of this place only that the desert around their walls is called the garden of bones every time the qartheen shut their gates on a traveller the garden grows there is something out there go on  you keep moving bring her about what kind of fire melts

but you know the queen and you know joffrey i fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital what do you want the lannisters will trade your daughters for the kingslayer of course they will five lannisters dead for every one of ours jaime lannister for two girls robb will never agree to those terms im not bringing these terms to him im bringing them to you you think i keep secrets from my son robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle but hes not a mother consider it cat you may not get another chance ive brought you a gift  i dont want your gifts theyre dead take everything theyve got a token of tyrion lannisters goodwill he wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith good faith whats this your husband was an honourable man he should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath winterfell you may not believe  get out get up you dogs thats him the one who picks doesnt mean id pick a bull in a fight weve nowhere to keep

lord stannis can that truly be you  who else might it be when i saw your standard i couldnt be sure whose banner is that  my own the officers will be useful i suppose if we used the same one the battle would be terribly confusing why is your stag on fire the king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the lord of light ah you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about mmm brother now i understand why you found religion in your old age watch yourself renly no no im relieved i never really believed you were a fanatic charmless rigid a bore yes some of them may be privy to tywin lannisters plans but not a godly man you should kneel before your brother hes the lords chosen born amidst salt and smoke born amidst salt and smoke is he a ham  thats twice ive warned you listen to yourselves if you were sons of mine i would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers it is strange to find you beside my brother lady stark i doubt it your husband was a supporter of my claim lord eddards integrity cost him his head and you sit beside this pretender and chastise me we share a common enemy the iron throne is mine by right all those that deny that are my foes the whole realm denies it from dorne to the wall old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs no one wants you for their king well well learn soon enough you never wanted any friends brother but a man without friends is a man without power for the sake of the mother who bore us i will give you this one night to reconsider strike your banners come to me before dawn and i will grant you your old seat in the council ill even name you my heir until a son is born to me otherwise i shall destroy you look across those fields brother can you see all those banners in my family we say a naked man has few secrets you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king no the men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king we shall see renly come the dawn we shall see look to your sins lord renly the night is dark and full of terrors would you believe i loved him once i thought we were welcome if you heard a dothraki horde was approaching your city a flayed man none you might do the same khaleesi horde my name is daenerys daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen you know me my lord only by reputation khaleesi and im no lord merely a humble merchant they call you the mother of dragons and what should i call you oh my name is quite long if the bull had fangs and claws i would my father outlawed flaying in the north and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce i am simply a trader of spices but we are the thirteen charged with the governance and protection of qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be the beauty of quarth is legendary  qarth qarth might we see the dragons my friend we have travelled very far were not in the north  were not torturing them we have no food no water once i see my people fed i would be honoured forgive me mother of dragons but no man alive has seen a living dragon some of my more sceptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist all we ask is the chance to see for ourselves i am not a liar oh i dont think you are the high roads very pretty but as ive never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value where i come from guests are treated with respect not insulted at the gates then perhaps you should return to where you come from we wish you well what are you doing you promised to receive me we have received you here we are and here you are but youll have a hard time marching your army down it if you do not let us in all of us will die which we shall deeply regret but qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting dothraki savages through its gates khaleesi please be careful thirteen when my dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me we will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground turn us away and we will burn you first the lannisters hold prisoners of their own ah you are a true targaryen only as you said a moment ago if we dont let you into the city you will all die and so retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be the discussion is over xaro xhoan daxos the thirteen have spoken i am one of the thirteen i wont give them an excuse to abuse my sisters and i am still speaking the girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine she is the mother of dragons do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire i believe we can allow a few dothraki through our gates without dooming our city after all here i am a savage from the summer isles and qarth still stands our decision is final no dont dont please very well i invoke soumai i will vouch for her her people and her dragons in accordance with the law be it on your head welcome to qarth my lady you is there gold or silver in the village im not from the village  where is the brotherhood i dont know what that is you two take lord lannisters things to his quarters the rots set in whats this we werent expecting you till tomorrow lord tywin evidently not why are these prisoners not in their cells cells are overflowing my lord this lot wont be here long dont need no permanent place after we interrogate em we usually just are we so wellmanned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled labourers you do

regent commands you to release grand maester pycelle heres your warrant  so it is will you take a cup with me i find that mulled wine helps me sleep i am here at her graces behest not to drink with you imp right the mountain or our man jaime itll get better it doesnt even hurt if my sister was so concerned for pycelle i would have thought shed come herself instead she sends you what am i to make of that i dont care what you make of it so long as you release your prisoner immediately and youve received these instructions directly from cersei as i said several times and youve waited this long to deliver the information when the queen regent gives me a command i carry it out without delay cersei must have great trust in you the rot will spread if we dont take the foot now allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf the queen regent has a great many responsibilities she often works from dusk till dawn she must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn ah lavender oil she always loved lavender oil even as a girl i am a knight an anointed knight yes tell me did cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed no you cant what nothing

beautiful woman and its all for the good of the realm go back and tell her that i beg her forgiveness that i want no more conflict between us and that henceforth i shall do nothing without her consent

not have him on the council i could swear that i had not harmed a single hair on his head but that would not strictly speaking be true stay within one table length your grace do your knucklebones

good man ser davos seaworth id say my parts are mixed my lady good and bad if half an onion is black with rot its a rotten onion a man is good or he is evil if he ever gets out its better than biting

women dont talk about my wife im not im talking about other women like me ser davos you want me you want to see whats beneath this robe whats your name  talisa and you will strange that this lord of

theyve barred the passage they cant bar our passage gods protect us theres only one god ser davos and he only protects those who serve him your last name you want to know what side my family fights on you know my family name you have me at a disadvantage that boy lost his foot on your orders they killed my father that boy did  the family he fights for do you think hes friends with king joffrey hes a fishermans son that grew up near lannisport loras tyrell he probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago i have no hatred for the lad that should help his foot grow back youd have us surrender end all this bloodshed i understand the country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good king joffrey youre going to kill joffrey  if the gods give me strength and then what  i dont know well go back to winterfell i have no desire to sit on the iron throne loras tyrell hes prettier than the queen so who will i dont know youre fighting to overthrow a king and yet you have no plan for what comes after first we have to win the war you never told me where youre from volantis  volantis youre far from home the boy was lucky you were here he was unlucky that you were youre here to answer for your brothers latest treasons i dont care about pretty hes better with a sword than any of them your grace whatever my traitor brother has done i had no part you know that i beg you please ser lancel tell her of this outrage using some vile sorcery your brother fell on stafford lannister with an army of wolves thousands of good men were butchered after the slaughter the northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain killing you would send your brother a message but my mother insists on keeping you alive ,4174
14,5,8.9,2,you swear it  by the mother and in return for my sons loyalty they are going to attack us we need to be ready no need to concern yourself over it the king is taking personal charge of siege preparations may i ask specifically what the king has in mind you may specifically or you may ask vaguely the answer will be the same its important that we talk about this its the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councillors in the morning ill destroy my brothers army its wildfire wildfire you wouldnt lie to me would you cousin no  thats a lie right there it is not a lie why would i lie tell me if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true do you think it will make jaime more likely to kill you or less likely when i tell him youre fucking her i mean im telling you the truth when thats done the smart money would be on more likely shes making wildfire but then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours the alchemists guild is being commissioned i suppose theres only one way to find out they have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults they are planning to launch it from the city walls into stannis ships and armies please when did she tell you this baratheon and stark will fight their common enemy together i heard her talking with the pyromancer and the other night after i left her she went to meet him i swear to you swear to me on what on my life but i dont care about your life in the light of the seven by all that is holy and right i lancel lannister do solemnly vow all right all right enough even torturing you is boring just get out as they have done many times before oh lancel tell my friend bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me please kill me if anything should happen to lord tyrion it will be my pleasure your grace what is it im sorry about your brother your grace i wanted to let you know that people grieve for him fools love a fool i grieve for him as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be our two houses have always been close i need to speak to you about what i saw in that cave  i thought i made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter your grace i ive never known you to need to hear a thing twice and ive never known you to hide from the truth youve come to lecture me on truth ive come to tell you that what i saw all my brothers bannermen have come to my side except the tyrells who fled like cowards which is why i am begging you to reconsider this battle they wont be able to resist us now soon i shall be sitting on the iron throne nothing is worth what this will cost you not even the iron ill hear no more about it take a company of men secure the perimeter when do we sail for kings landing as soon as ive consolidated my troops well make short work of the lannisters fleet once blackwater bay is cleared well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city negotiate a peace with your brother and will you bring lady melisandre with you thats not your concern if you take kings landing with her by your side the victory will be hers i never thought id have reason to doubt your loyalty was i wrong loyal service means telling hard truths oh truth again all right whats the truth the hard truth shes a foreigner preaching her foreign religion some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey negotiate with stannis what do you believe you won those bannermen from renly dont lose them to her we set out for kings landing without lady melisandre and you lead the fleet into blackwater bay your grace im honoured but my time on the sea was spent evading ships not attacking them the other lords wont be happy most of those lords should consider themselves lucky i dont hang them for treason you heard him out there hard truths cut both ways ser davos ive got it ive got it so its that one there at the top on the right buy my fruit my lord fresh fruit stannis has more infantry more ships more horses what do we have theres that mind of yours you keep going on about well ive never actually been able to kill people with it good thing id be out of a job what about your father my son has no interest in the iron throne id have better luck debating the wind he hasnt sent a raven in weeks hes very busy being repeatedly humiliated by robb stark is timeconsuming we wont be able to hold the city against stannis not the way joffreys planning on holding it corruption  yes we are swollen bloated foul brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten yes a rotten king please bring my terms to your son its hard to argue with his assessment not after what he did to your birthday present the king is a lost cause its the rest of us im worried about now a dancing king prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey you have to admire his imagination hes talking about you what demon monkey people think youre pulling the kings strings i believe we are natural allies they blame you for the citys ills blame me im trying to save them you dont need to convince me demon monkey yeah come on youre the crew of the sea bitch im your commander welcome stop stop your captain commands you to stop i hope he feels the same where are we headed captain the stony shore to raid their

task my father has given me to prove that im a true iron islander theyre all iron islanders do they do as theyre told or do they do as they like the stony shores not far from torrhens square the seat of the house of tallhart follow me a more impressive prize than a few fishermens daughters what you dont think we could take it  no we could we could never hold it for more than a few days as soon as winterfell got word that wed taken torrhens square the starks would send their men to take it back and then take me to my ship the starks have overextended their lines now that summers over theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed youll die for this  no wait it wasnt her the starks understand winter better than we ever will the cold wont beat them our spies report growing discontent among the northern lords they want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn and im sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords this is war no ones content weve underestimated the stark boy for too long he has a good mind for warfare his men worship him and as long as he keeps winning battles theyll keep believing he is king in the north weve got to leave youve been waiting for him to fail he is not going to fail not without our help so how do we stop him weve worked through the night my lord perhaps wed profit from some sleep yes i think you would reginald and because youre my cousin i might even let you wake from that sleep go im sure your wife must miss you my wifes in lannisport well then youd better start riding then i see no reason for hostility between us theyll hang you for this go before i change my mind and send her your head if your name wasnt lannister youd

halfhand beautiful isnt it gilly would love it here theres nothing more sickening than a man in love get out about time you did something at least youll keep warm the fist of the first men think of how old this place is before the targaryens defeated the andals before the andals took westeros from the first men before i die please stop talking thousands and thousands of years ago the first men stood here where were standing all through the long night what do you think they were like the first men stannis will be here in an hour stupid smart people dont find themselves in places like this i think they were afraid i think they came here to get away from something and i dont think it worked wildlings one blast is for rangers returning wildlings is two blasts so you got to stand there waiting wondering your son can go on calling himself king in the north when he arrives renlys bannermen will flock to him one blast for friends two for foes and three for white walkers its been a thousand years but thats the only time they blow the horn three times but if its been a thousand years how do you know well  i read it in a book look its qhorin halfhand aye well live another day your former companions will fight for the privilege hurrah take care my lord i remember reading an old sailors proverb piss on wildfire and your cock burns off oh i have not conducted this experiment it could well be true the substance burns so hot it melts wood stone even steel and of course flesh the substance burns so hot it melts flesh like tallow after the dragons died wildfire was the key to the targaryen power of selling you to their new king my companion takes issue if i could tell you how many crazy old men ive seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit no offence meant  our order does not deal in pig shit the substance is fire given form and we have been perfecting it since the days of maegor to do what the jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy how much do you have if you could get real soldiers to man the catapults and you want that privilege for yourself then maybe youd hit your target one time in ten but all the real soldiers are in the riverlands with your father my lord this man is insulting i dont know if youve ever seen a battle old man but things can get a bit messy cause when were flinging things at stannis hes flinging them right back at us men die men shit themselves men run which means pots falling which means fire inside the walls which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down you will note that i am standing here talking to you my friend remains unconvinced he would not dare insult my order whilst aerys targaryen lived well hes not living any more and all his pots of wildfire didnt help him did they men win wars not magic tricks we have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so our present count stands at enough to burn stannis baratheons fleet and armies both this is a shit idea not stannis im afraid i have to concur with my adviser wisdom hallyne the contents of this room could lay kings landing low you wont be making wildfire for my sister any longer youll be making it for me hell be able to feed himself from now on let him sleep doreah yes khaleesi he loves you i rewove this part of the top and i fixed the heel on this one theres no time for this thank you my friend did you see the dress xaro had made for you they say hes the wealthiest man in qarth it is known and if qarth is the wealthiest city in essos the last time a rich man gave me a dress he was selling me to khal drogo may he ride forever through the night lands xaro is our host but we know nothing about him men like to talk about other men when theyre happy you would look like a real princess in xaros ride back to highgarden sister shes not a princess shes a khaleesi you should wear it khaleesi you are their guest it would be rude not to and you must visit the night market the qartheen night market is like no night market youve ever seen it sounds wonderful the meereenis think they have a night market i will take you there myself please excuse me for a moment what are they doing im not running from stannis malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry kovarro says that malakko is an idiot they can pry out the gems the rest is pure gold very soft he can chop off as much as we can carry or melt it very simple we are his guests you cant pry it or chop it or melt it of course not khaleesi we will wait until we leave not even when we leave brienne of tarth murdered renly why not our host saved us from the red waste and you want to steal from him i will hear no more my brother used to say the only thing the dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built its not the only thing theyre quite good at killing the better men thats not the kind of queen im going to be mother of dragons on behalf of the warlocks of qarth i welcome you the starks will have dominion over all lands north of moat cailin i dont believe that a demonstration take this gem look at it into its depths so many facets look closely enough and you can see yourself in them often more than once should you grow tired of xaros baubles and trinkets it would be an honour to host you at the house of the undying you are always welcome mother of dragons you dont believe that my apologies pyat pree is one of the thirteen it was customary for me to extend him an invitation customs die slow deaths in qarth what is the house of the undying it is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening it turns their lips blue and their minds soft so soft they actually believe their parlour tricks are magic you watch over her who gained the most from our kings death do i know you i know you jorah mormont of bear island who are you im no one but she is the mother of dragons she needs true protectors now more than ever they shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again and when they see they shall lust for dragons are fire made flesh stannis and fire is power it looked like stannis to me it just looked like a shadow in the shape of a man in the shape of stannis we should reach my sons camp tomorrow will you stay there long my lady only long enough to tell robb what i have seen after that i will leave for winterfell my two youngest need me i will put a sword through his righteous face ive been away from them for far too long i never knew my mother im sorry my own mother died on the birthing bed when i was very young its a bloody business what comes after is even harder once youre safely back amongst your own people will you give me leave to go my lady you mean to kill stannis you cant stay here i swore a vow but stannis has a great army around him his own guards are sworn to keep him safe im as good as any of them i should never have fled renlys death was no fault of yours you served him bravely i only held him that once as he was dying hes gone brienne he would have been a true king you serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth renlys enemies are robbs enemies as well i do not know your son my lady but i could serve you if you would have me you have courage not battle courage perhaps but i dont know a womans kind of courage and i think that when the time comes you will not hold me back promise me that you will not hold me back from stannis when the time comes i will not hold you back a good king then i am yours my lady i will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that i swear it by the old gods and the new i vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that i shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonour i swear it by the old gods and the new and its not just thieves my lord theres wolves in them hills now more than i ever seen tell me ser loras they come down in the night and they kill my sheep my three sons is away fighting for your brother my lord theyll fight keep fighting till theyre told to go home i have no one to man my flock

for more children well look after them thank you my lord what do you desire most in this world and may the gods bless you and yours stop it if thats everyone im going to go for a ride before dark good  hodor hodor  ah lord stark torrhens square is under siege torrhens square is barely  leagues from here how can the lannisters strike so far north might be a raiding party led by the mountain might be sellswords paid by tywin lannister provided he swears me an oath of fealty revenge we have to help them most of the fighting men are away with robb but i can gather  decent men do you need so many if we cant protect our own bannermen why should they protect us go ser rodrik take the men you need wont take long my lord southerners dont do well up here so what does it mean ask your maester luwin hes the one studying books all the time i did ask him hed never heard of a threeeyed raven must not mean anything then i have always found that to be the purest of motivations youre lying you might be a little lord but dont you call me a liar you know what it means  i never said i didnt you didnt give me an honest answer thats not the same as being a liar well its not far off so youve been dreaming of a threeeyed raven again in the godswood you told me you didnt dream now whos a liar what did you see in your dream but you wont have a chance to put your sword through stannis something bad tell me boy i dreamt that the sea came to winterfell i saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls it flooded the castle drowned men were floating here in the yard ser rodrik was one of them the sea is hundreds of miles away not today i know its just a stupid dream  ive got to get these potatoes to the kitchen otherwise theyll put me in chains again osha the threeeyed raven what do they say about it north of the wall they say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall there  where on that mountain i dont see very well youll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground a fire theres a fire the people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine when they see us coming that fire becomes a signal gives mance rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honour how many wildlings have joined him from what we can tell all of them mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves theyre almost ready to make their move where  somewhere safe if it is justice that you want be smart about it somewhere south cant just march into their midst and we cant wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us you saying we should fall back to the wall mance was one of us once now hes one of them hes going to teach them our way of doing things theyll hit us in force and they wont run away when we hit back theyre gonna be more organised than before more disciplined more like us you cant avenge him from the grave so we need to be more like them do things their way sneak in kill mance and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the wall and to do that  we need to get rid of those lookouts its not a job for  men i need to move fast and silent harker stonesnake borba lord commander id like to join lord qhorin ive been called lots of things but that might be my first lord qhorin youre a steward snow not a ranger bring the horses ive fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that hes the one aye you killed a wight you also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword craster in the boys defence thats a tough old goat i could take up jons duties while hes gone my lord it would be no trouble well i hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward please go on so tell me how long has your manservant been in love with you hes not my manservant and hes not in love with me hes my adviser my friend unlikely i can almost always tell what a man wants and what about what a woman wants much more complicated he was very handsome you for example what do you want to cross the narrow sea and take back the iron throne why because i promised my khalasar id protect them and find them a safe home you want to conquer the seven kingdoms for the dothraki i want them because theyre mine by right the iron throne is mine and i will take it ah a conqueror and how did you get all of this did someone give it to you and the wording of this oath he was your grace no i come from nothing i hit the docks like a piece of cargo except someone normally cares what happens to cargo so you wanted more than you had and you took it youre a conqueror too youre just less ambitious what do you want xaro xhoan daxos at the gates of the city you bled for me why i will show you why the door and the vault is made of valyrian stone the hardest steel does not make a mark your grace i offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it i made the same offer to the greatest thieves they all went home emptyhanded the only thing that can open this door is this key and behind the door and it can all be mine all let us say half more than enough to buy horses ships armies enough to go home calling yourself king doesnt make you one all i have to do is marry me that was a romantic proposal ive already married once for love but the gods stole her from me i come from nothing my mother and father never owned a pair of shoes but marry me and i will give you the seven kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses see i have more ambition than you thought and if renly wasnt a king i wasnt a queen the time is right daenerys targaryen first of your name robert baratheon is dead if you cross the sea with an army you bought the seven kingdoms are at war with one another four false kings destroying the country to win westeros you need support from westeros the usurper is dead the starks fight the lannisters and baratheons fight each other according to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand the time to strike is now we need to find ships and an army do you want to be a queen or well spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever moving carefully is the hard way but its the right way and if id listened to that advice outside the gates of qarth wed all be dead by now i know the opportunity before you seems like the last youll ever have but you must  do not speak to me like im a child i only want  what do you want tell me no to see you on the iron throne  why you have a good claim a title a birthright but you have something more than that you may cover it up and deny it but you have a gentle heart you would not only be respected and feared you would be loved someone who can rule and should rule centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world there are times when i look at you and i still cant believe youre real so what would you have me do as my adviser i want to be the queen make your own way find your own ship you only need one the allies we need are in westeros not qarth and how do i get the ship ill find it for you a sound ship with a good captain i look forward to meeting him khaleesi you should stand sideface sideface killed by whom sideways why smaller target am i fighting someone youre practising for a fight you should practise right guards did you see anything go up there go and see where he fell from go up the battlement accounts differ move away stand back hes dead most seem to implicate catelyn stark in some way the same ned stark swore to robert  years ago really whod have thought some say it was one of his own kingsguard while still others say it was stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour whomever did it i say well done its not what varys says he says renlys army is flocking to support stannis which would give stannis superiority over us on both land and sea littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one and i say father raised you to have too much respect for money cat their friendship held the kingdoms together stannis baratheon is coming for us sooner rather than later arent there other things you should be doing like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away shell be safer in dorne yes i know how concerned you are for her safety it so happens that i am myrcella is a sweet innocent girl and i dont blame her at all for you so clever arent you always so clever with your schemes and your plots schemes and plots are the same thing ,5521

wall well fight you and throw you out theyll never know what youve done theyll never know how you died they wont even know your damn name but theyll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the

still yours my cupbearer can read better than you to whom does house dormand owe allegiance my lord i to the starks of winterfell who have  men and my son i judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants i see i overestimated you if you ever put my sons life at risk again ill leave us put the book away girl theon  its prince theon now youll yield to keep them safe maybe you

from renly baratheons camp ah the late king renly to keep them alive rather a short reign murdered by a woman i hear so they say there has been talk of other forces at work dark forces here men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel it is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after you say that as if you were the first man alive to think it yes a crisis is an opportunity thats what a good lord would do what other brilliant insights have you brought me today after the lannisters and the starks the tyrells command the largest host their lands are the most fertile in the seven kingdoms feeding horses and soldiers  yes yes yes the tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings loras wants revenge he blames stannis for renlys death and margaery wants to be queen yes she does house tyrell rebelled against the iron throne think carefully about what you want to say against my grandson  they did and perhaps that treason should be punished one day after stannis and robb stark are defeated more wine for lord baelish if you will allow me to represent your familys interests i believe that an advantageous agreement the tyrell host has returned to highgarden they have pardon my lord theon its only wine you would ride there yourself tonight with your leave ill have an answer by nightfall thatll be all girl and what else on your son tyrions directive i met with catelyn stark why he had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters did you hate us the whole time hmm a girl  a wildling we could question her you could

he makes everyone wait of course you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in qarth i already have a husband khal drogo is gone khaleesi you are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful if you think you can hold the north with it  shut up and you are far too smart to think that i will succumb to flattery i have travelled very far in my life and met many women but none that are immune to flattery the mother of dragons here he comes forgive me i had terrible dreams last night terrible dreams i could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing if you serve me as loyally as you served ned stark look what a beauty you are now the red waste has been washed off you i am sorry about all that unpleasantness the silver hair of a true targaryen xaro xhoan daxos she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself very true and yet they say that your grandfather who sold pepper off the back of a wagon married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself every lady alive was lovelier i will be as good to you as he ever was  steady and higher born than my grandfather did my servants not offer you something to eat to drink ill have them flogged in the square thank you my lord you are a gracious host but there is no servant alive that can bring me what i want oh she has a talent for drama this one so my little princess what is it you want my birthright the seven kingdoms of westeros i fear im no better than a servant in this regard betray me and you will wish you hadnt i cannot give you what i do not have im not asking you for the kingdoms im asking you for ships i need to cross the narrow sea i need my ships as well i use them you see to bring spices from one port to another whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when i retake the iron throne retake did you once sit on the iron throne maester luwin send a raven to pyke my father sat there before he was murdered but if you did not sit on it yourself would it not be correct to say take the iron throne i didnt come here to argue grammar of course not you came to take my ships so let me explain my position little princess unlike you i do not have exalted ancestors i make my living by trade and i judge every trade on its merits you ask for ships informing my father of my victory here you say i shall be repaid triple i do not doubt your honesty or your intentions but before you repay your debts you must seize the seven kingdoms do you have an army  not yet you do not have an army do you have powerful allies in westeros there are many there that support my claim when were you there last i left when i was a baby and one to deepwood motte to my sister so in truth you have no allies the people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when i return ah forgive me little princess but i cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams now if youll pardon me do you know illyrio mopatis magister of pentos yes weve met a shrewd man for my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs he believed the world believed that the ages had turned them to stone inform her that shes to bring  men to winterfell how many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies but i dreamt that if i carried those eggs into a great fire they would hatch when i stepped into the fire my own people thought i was mad but when the fire burned out i was unhurt the mother of dragons do you understand im no ordinary woman my dreams come true you are a maester of the citadel i admire your passion but in business i trust in logic not passion im sorry little princess i am not your little princess i am daenerys stormborn of the blood of old valyria and i will take what is mine with fire and blood i will take it yes my lady but not with my ships who taught you to read my father my lord i took it im occupying it sworn to serve the lord of winterfell are you not hmm i taught my son jaime to read the maester came to me one day told me he wasnt learning he couldnt make sense of the letters he reversed them in his head the maester said hed heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it ha after that i sat jaime down for four hours every day until he learned he hated me for it for a time i am for a long time but he learned hmm where is your father is he alive who was he a stonemason a stonemason who could read hmm he taught himself quite a man i am the lord of winterfell as bran just informed you what killed him loyalty youre a sharp little thing arent you did forgive me my lord i shouldnt ask questions no but youve already begun did you know your father my lord i did i grew up with him send the ravens i watched him grow old he loved us he was a good man but a weak man a weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name im cold ill fetch more wood for the fire my lord mmm where are you going girl the armoury my lord my lord why  lord tywin sent me what might this be lord tywin gave it to me what for to take to the armoury why would he do that lets go and ask him move get out of the way amory lorch my lord greyjoy a girl has named a second name a man will do

grace  your grace my honour your grace i see youve finally learned how to address your betters your grace your grace  quent lady talisa your grace im not sure im a lady westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me its hard to keep all the rules straight but if i remember my lessons a woman of noble birth is always called a lady unless shes a queen or a princess what do you want i could find someone who knows why are you so sure im of noble birth because its obvious what if i told you my father sold lace on the long bridge and my mother my brother and i lived with him above our shop id call you a liar not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty i always thought i was a brilliant liar better at amputations im afraid quite a pretty spot i was brought here a captive will we be here long i couldnt really discuss troop movements with you im not a spy of course a spy would deny being a spy youre right youve found me out im writing a letter to the lannisters the young wolf is on the move perhaps youd join me if youve got time of course for well robb mother you were here the day i was taken mother this is lady talisa shes been helping with the wounded shes been very helpful lady

a greyjoy i must go north at once theres still a war to win your grace how can i call myself king if i cant hold my own castle how can i ask men to follow me if i cant  you are a king put a spear in my hand again and that means you dont have to do everything yourself let me go and talk to theon there will be no talk he will die for this theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew let me send word to my bastard at the dreadfort he can raise a few hundred men and retake winterfell before the new moon we have the lannisters on the run if you march all the way back north now youll lose what you gained my boy would be honoured to bring you prince theons head tell your son bran and rickons safety is paramount so you can bury it in my neck do you take me for a fool and theon i want him brought to me alive i want to look him in the eye and ask him why and then ill take his head myself why on earth would i trust the word of a lying little savage like you im no liar all wildlings are liars and

look at it now a blasted ruin do you know what happened dragons yes dragons happened halt harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land a million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been repelled but an attack from the air with dragon fire mmmmmm harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls aegon targaryen changed the rules thats why every child alive still knows his name years after his death aegon and his sisters mmm enjoying your first hunt it wasnt just aegon riding his dragon it was rhaenys and visenya too correct a student of history are you rhaenys rode meraxes visenya rode vhagar im sure i knew that when i was a boy visenya targaryen was a great warrior she had a valyrian steel sword she called dark sister hmm so far hunting seems very similar to riding my lord shes a heroine of yours i take it arent most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs jonquil with the flowers in her hair most girls are idiots you remind me of my daughter where did you learn all this stuff about visenya and her valyrian steel sword from my father he was a wellread stonemason cant say ive ever met a literate stonemason have

he wanted to be free you could be free too you dont need to live your whole life taking commands from old men wake up when you want to wake up i could show you the streams to fish the woods to hunt build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead youre a pretty lad the girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you walk i could teach you how to do it i know how to do it you know nothing jon snow and what did she say she admired your spirit your grace and what then she they have no value to me missing if

my place is by your side i shouldnt have left you alone with these people its all just a game these people they are not to be trusted and who is to be trusted who are my people the targaryens i only knew one my brother and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown the dothraki most of them turned on me the day that khal drogo fell from his horse your people are in westeros we should have took more food the people in westeros dont know im alive they will soon enough  and then what theyll pray for my return theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name thats what my brother believed and he was a fool you are not your brother trust me khaleesi there it is trust me and its you i should trust ser jorah we couldnt risk going to the kitchens only you i dont need

you please tell me how find my dragons how long till we get back to your crows those people all love you they would have given you whatever you needed were close what a day a halfday you dont know do you do you even know where they are  were close what do you think theyll say when they hear about you and me nothing happened between you and me i swear it old master king crow ser we were only close together for warmth and then i felt it right up against me backside like a club i can show you the bruise on me tailbone and if theon found out hed hang them and before i knew what was where his his well it was all out in the open all angry as you like and i didnt want to want it but oh i did and he spread me legs and ruined the shame of it now i can never marry a perfumed lord what will me poor savage father say turn back around and i thought that we were done but he said turn back around the boy cant survive on walnuts  im fine ill tell you what jon snow since its gonna be your word against mine and since you cant talk about it without blushing we may as well just what right here in the muck ill keep you warm enough are you that afraid of it thats enough its nice and wet the giant must have took him weve been walking since before sunrise and warm enough it dont have teeth all right all right gods youre dull should have took me while you had the chance no no no oh no its all right give me that even hodor will tire  hodor if the queen sees i can have joffreys children now help me flip it over where are you going  to tell her grace youll say nothing to anyone do you understand your mother might have prepared you you flowered my dear no more my mother told me but i thought it would be different in what way i thought it would be less even you sweet giant   hodor less messy wait until you birth a child youre a woman now do you have any idea what that means im fit to bear children for the king a prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world the greatest honour for a queen joffrey has always been difficult even his birth i laboured a day and a half to bring him into this world you cannot imagine the pain wait i know that farm i screamed so loudly i was sure robert would hear me in the kingswood his grace was not with you robert was hunting that was his custom whenever my time was near my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds and when he returned he would present me with some pelts or a stags head and i would present him with a baby not that i wanted him there mind you i had grand maester pycelle an army of midwives and i had my brother i sent those two winterfell orphans there when they told jaime he wasnt allowed in the birthing room he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out joffrey will show you no such devotion you may never love the king but you will love his children i love his grace with all my heart thats so very touching to hear permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day the more people you love the weaker you are jack and billy youll do things for them that you know you shouldnt do youll act the fool to make them happy to keep them safe love no one but your children on that front a mother has no choice but shouldnt i love joffrey your grace you can try little dove who did you say your mother was again cinda lannister is she the fat one theyll give us some food  we cant risk it well perhaps shes gotten a little larger than she no no theres only one fat lannister if she was your mother youd know it i squired for you once you know when the tournament the day of willem freys wedding i went to willem freys wedding you did your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up he threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds what was his name if theon tracks us here hell torture them until he finds out where we are bryan poor lad that was my brothers doing i seem to recall i remember you youd never squired for anyone before thats right i ran up and volunteered let me my lord let me my father was furious afraid id embarrass our family in front of the family you didnt though you really remember billy climbs a tree better than anyone you knew when you were needed and when to go away its a rare talent most of my squires they mean well but young men with big jobs they tend to overdo them when i think back to that day  shh you were saying i never mind its embarrassing more embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit i remember everything about that day your helmet your horse youve never seen me climb a tree little man the rake lines in the dirt along the list where the sun was in the sky when you knocked balon swann from his horse and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me ill remember it all until i die that was the best day of my life and i remember being on the field after it was over all the competitors were done i was the last one out there and i couldnt leave i couldnt bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride the giant theyll be after us with hounds and i couldnt bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when i knew that they could never have the faintest idea what i was talking about i understand completely how could you sorry i i didnt mean to doubt you its just that i i was  once i also had to replace someones squire on short notice which knight was it barristan selmy the fight against the kingswood outlaws before your time we got a good start on them but we cant outrun hounds forever what was he like he was a painter a painter who only used red i couldnt imagine being able to fight like that not back then and to help him do that to be a part of something that perfect i dont need to explain how that felt not to you its hard to put into words its like stepping into a dream youve been dreaming for as long as you can remember did you pull a knife on me in the night and finding out that the dream is more real than your life leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison did you squire for him again  no i didnt have your gift he couldnt take a step without stepping on me i was awful a complete liability until one of the outlaws decided to take on a yearold squire its a good thing i am who i am whats the matter id have been useless at anything else im not wellsuited for imprisonment shocking i know some men are ned stark i imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end not me though my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint and have you thought about of course every day cant be the first time you pressed your bone against a womans arse and good prisoners breed good jailers apparently the starks are very careful but there is a way i think it wasnt possible until now what is it its actually quite simple  well let me help you youll only have to do one thing tell me youll have to die lets move jorah the andal this man must sail past old valyria all who travel too close to the doom must have protection i didnt come here for lessons no you came for the dragons you have them where are they draw your sword see what your steel is worth you want to please the mother of dragons it is the first time you love her where are the dragons will you betray her again jorah the andal will you betray her again never the thief you seek is with her now i did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief no one is calling you a thief who is she to accuse us how old are you boy please theyre my children im begging you begging us it wasnt very long ago you were threatening us without me the dragons will die it will be for the best your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery my dear if i knew where they were i would not tell you you are cruel my friend the mother of dragons is in the right she must be reunited with her babies i will help you khaleesi  how im a man of the nights watch i will take you to the house of the undying where i have put them you have my dragons when i learned you were coming to our city i made an arrangement with the king of qarth he procured them for me but there is no king of qarth there is now that was the other half of the arrangement you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls but qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change i will open qarth to the world as i have forced it to open itself to me your ambition is an inspiration youre a boy whos never been with a girl but like all upstarts you overreach three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king an upstart and a charlatan empires have been built by less those on the margins often come to control the centre and those in the centre make room for them willingly or otherwise the mother of dragons will be with her babies she will give them her love and they will thrive by her side forever hodor dont your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets a mother should be with her children where will you run to daenerys stormborn your dragons wait for you in the house of the undying come see them lady stark  no farther keep your hands off me woman dont enter without an invitation man forgive me lady stark what is it  they caught the kingslayer kingslayer dont call them that kill the fucking kingslayer hang him  hang him youll die today justice for the karstark gut him get back i want his head any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death lord karstark this man is our prisoner this monster killed my son and crippled mine what stones he will answer for his crimes i promise you but not here i will have his head and if you try and stop me you will strike me down have you forgotten me ser i am the widow of your liege lord eddard stark i am the mother of your king and where is our king now  you know very well he has gone to the crag to accept the surrender aye gone to the crag but not to negotiate he brought that foreign bitch with him  how dare you or bone threatening my lady is an act of treason  treason how can it be treason to kill lannisters i understand your grief my lord better than most i understand it but in the name of my son the king in the north stand down when your son returns i will demand this murderers head wise men do not make demands of kings fathers who love their sons do i will have his head thank you for fighting on my behalf lady stark neither i would have come to your defence but take him to the stockades bind him with every chain you can find youve become a real shewolf in your later years theres not much fish left in you and gag him since when do you light your own candles since i decided that i cant stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant how many times can you read one raven scroll stannis baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past tarth  ships both more than we have  yes thats more than we have hell be at our gates within five days four if he has the wind we have strong high walls well rain fire down on them from above rain fire on them from above youre quoting father arent you why not he has a good mind for strategy doesnt he call it tactics not strategy but yes he does have a good mind for it the best mind some would say sadly hes not here move its just you me and joffrey the lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm im sure youll make a point eventually he needs to start acting like a king this war you started is coming to our doorstep and if the entire city wants joffrey dead im not the one giving the boy whores to abuse i thought the girls might help him did you  i was wrong if we cant control him i heard they get all swollen and bruised if you dont use them do you think i havent tried he doesnt listen to me its hard to put a leash on a dog once youve put a crown on its head i always hoped hed be like jaime he looks like him in a certain light the boy is more robert than jaime robert was a drunken fool but he didnt enjoy cruelty sometimes i wonder what of course maybe thats just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them if this is the price for what weve done for our sins sins the targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years i know thats what jaime and i would say to each other in our moments of doubt its what i told ned stark when he was stupid enough to confront me half the targaryens went mad didnt they whats the saying as if id feel sorry for them every time a targaryen is born the gods flip a coin youve beaten the odds tommen and myrcella are good decent children both of them then why wait  were sworn to the king theres not a king  thats treason so is saving lannisters yeah back off you  no i wont your son returns at dawn my lady so they say the kingslayer wont last the night oh thats all right then are there no girl crows the more they drink the angrier theyll get and when the karstarks draw their swords who wants to die defending a lannister come hell not be making it through the night i need to be alone with him my lady our orders  your orders which i just gave you are to leave me alone with him come to say goodbye lady stark i believe its my last night in this world there are no women of the nights watch no is that a woman do you hear them out there they want your head old lord karstark doesnt seem to like me you strangled his son with your chains oh oh was he the one on guard duty he was in my way any knight would have done the same  you are no knight you have forsaken every vow you ever took so the lads just do it with each other so many vows they make you swear and swear defend the king obey the king obey your father protect the innocent defend the weak but what if your father despises the king what if the king massacres the innocent its too much no matter what you do youre forsaking one vow or another where did you find this beast she is a truer knight than you will ever be no kingslayer  kingslayer what a king he was heres to aerys targaryen the second of his name lord of the seven kingdoms protector of the realm and to the sword i shoved in his back you are a man without honour do you know ive never been with any woman but cersei so in my own way i have more honour than never  never poor old dead ned what was the name of that bastard he fathered brienne  no that wasnt it snow a bastard from the north now when when good old ned came home with some whores baby did you pretend to love it no youre not very good at pretending youre an honest woman you hated that boy didnt you we swore an oath how could you not hate him the walking talking reminder that the honourable lord eddard stark fucked another woman your sword i told you what would happen all of you i told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not what are you doing what have you done you have sheep at the wall if there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says here is the answer to your question no with your hands then no wonder youre all so miserable would you please shut up  would you please shut up you let a halfwit escape with a cripple you think youre better than me crow im a free woman  youre a free woman i might be your prisoner but im a free woman if youre my prisoner youre not a free woman thats what prisoner means and you think youre free you swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl it was my choice to say the words so you dont like girls  of course i like girls but you chose never to touch them thats the price you pay if you want to be a man of the nights watch and rickon too the little one so instead of getting naked with a girl youd prefer to invade our lands invade your lands wildlings raid our lands all the time some of them tried to kill my little brother a crippled boy theyre not your lands weve been here the whole time you lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours my father was ned stark i have the blood of the first men my ancestors lived here same as yours ,5267
17,8,8.9,2,riders approaching  open the gate you treated them with honour by butchering them he was the best man i ever met i know children always think that about their fathers but children do not always think that about their fathers believe me he once told me that being a lord is like being a father except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them the farmers ploughing the fields are yours to protect the charwomen scrubbing the floors yours to protect the soldiers you order into battle he told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night i didnt believe him before i had to kill them i asked him how can a man be brave if hes afraid that is the only time a man can be brave he told me i wish i could have met him he would have liked you most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors he didnt care much about gold or glory  and you you think im fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me i want to go home i want the men following me to go home  then why dont you i treated them  you seized their home as is your right because well never be safe until the lannisters are defeated and because i believe in justice chopping off joffreys head you mean  that would be a start your grace milady the kingslayer he escaped in the night how how tell me this isnt true why for the girls were ironborn we take what we need you betrayed me  robb no you knew i would not allow it and you did it anyway bran and rickon are captives in winterfell sansa and arya are captives in kings landing i have five children and only one of them is free i lost one son fighting by your sons side i lost another to the kingslayer strangled with a chain you commit treason because your children are prisoners i would carve out my heart and offer it to the father exactly if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell i grieve for your sons my lord  i dont want your grief i want my vengeance and you stole it from me killing jaime lannister would not buy life for your children but returning him to kings landing may buy life for mine jaime lannister has played you for a fool youve weakened our position youve brought discord into our camp and you did it all behind my back then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away make sure shes guarded day and night  robb how many men did we send in pursuit of the kingslayer forty your grace send another  with our fastest horses robb damn youre much uglier in daylight whats your name im jaime lannister of

gold catches the light so youre nice and easy to spot at night well youre not sneaking through alleyways any longer youre supposed to stand out we had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasnt part of it fine fine go on then warn me no gold cloak what what  what what why are you staring at me you dont want me cleaning me nails you dont want me looking your way why am i here to help me plan the defence of kings landing stannis will be here any day and one of these explains how to beat him an history of the great sieges of westeros you havent brought enough men by archmaester shevelathin shevelatesh chevalteesh id swap all your books for a few good archers my lord hand commander i must compliment you on the gold cloaks performance these last few weeks did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery i did not know and how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery how am i supposed to defend winterfell with just this lot me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves for questioning no its just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now we talked about this  aye we talked about it have you ever been in a city under siege maybe this parts not in your books see its not the fighting that kills most people its the starving foods worth more than gold noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes envy isnt attractive  what envy youre not things get bad enough the poor start eating each other the thieves they love a siege soon as the gates are sealed they steal all the food by the time its all over theyre the richest men in town given the circumstances my lord i believe extreme measures are warranted ah the great sieges of westeros thrilling subject shame archmaester chvyalthan wasnt a better writer stannis knows kings landing ive come to bring you home father wants a word he knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest the mud gate a good ram will batter it down in minutes and its only  yards from the water thats where hell land and if stannis does attack the mud gate what is our plan we could throw books at his men we dont have that many books is this a joke we dont have that many men either what do we have pig shit im not cut out for this sort of work i always imagined meself doing something much worse were digging latrine pits at the end of the world i cant imagine anything much worse you lack imagination where do you think jon is right now he went off with the halfhand he didnt come back winterfell is the heart of the north a betting man would go with dead hes not dead no jons a great fighter well hes better than me and a lot better than you hes got a valyrian steel sword so did his father and qhorin halfhand is the greatest ranger alive great rangers never get old is the problem shit ones neither its them in the middle that last a long time aye it is hundreds of miles from the sea what in seven hells is that the first men made these marks help me with it look if you find something youre not supposed to best thing to do is pretend youve never seen it thats a nights watch cloak its been here a long time oh must be dragonglass were islanders baby brother had you forgotten that dragonglass the maesters call it obsidian why would a brother hide it here i expect its cause he wanted somebody to find it mind where youre going im sorry ill where were you a man has patrol duty tywin lannister was right here and now hes gone a girl owes one more name our power comes from our ships the red god demands it give the man a name how long after i give you the name does it take you to kill someone a minute an hour a month death is certain the time is not hes taking his army to attack my brother i need him dead right now this a man cannot do you promised youd help me help was not promised lovely girl only death and now that youve decorated your walls with the bodies of the stark boys there must be others give a name any name and youll kill them anybody by the seven new gods and the old gods beyond counting i swear it all right jaqen hghar a girl gives a man his own name thats right  gods are not mocked this is no joking thing  im not joking every man in the north wants to see you hanged a man can go kill himself unname me no  please ill unname you thank you  if you help me and my friends escape this would require more than one life this is not part of our bargain  fine jaqen hghar a girl lacks honour if i do this thing a girl must obey a girl will obey when robb stark finds out  he wont find out a girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight thank you podrick odd little boy i have a certain sympathy for odd little boys you and varys both excellent lamprey pie were you slaving away in the kitchen all day i hear joffrey plans on

wicked old rebel hes only a boy younger boys are off fighting his war hes not ready  what is he remember jaime at   better than you some men have a gift for this sort of thing some dont his place is not on the battlefield its not on the throne either sadly for all of us we have all the horses do you think im an idiot no id say you possess aboveaverage intelligence you shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die hell have his kingsguard protecting him he has the finest armour gold can buy he needs to be out there the men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts any dessert ive taken winterfell do you know why varys is so dangerous because he has thousands of spies in his employ because he knows everything we do before we do it because he doesnt have a cock neither do you perhaps im dangerous too you on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man that little worm between your legs does half your thinking its not that little why are you smiling and i will keep winterfell because im happy and why are you happy because i have your little whore i thought you preferred blondes such a droll little fellow tell me have you married this one yet no good father will be so pleased why do you care who i fuck because a lannister always pays her debts leave us you

in time where did you find her varys isnt the only one who hears whispers theon youre my blood really a lannister lion necklace you need to hide your secret whores more carefully youve forgotten the most important thing about whores oh well youre the expert tell me you dont buy them you only rent them youre usually a better liar baby brother this one you like you like her very much we both loved our mother could it be love dont worry shell be treated gently enough unless joffrey is hurt and then every wound he suffers shell suffer too and if he dies there isnt a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt and how do i know you havent killed her already would you like to see her i thought you might ser mandon bring in my brothers whore we both endured our father im sorry they hurt you you must be brave i promise i will free you dont forget me never i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think youre safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid get out come home with me dont die here alone shae ive been waiting all night what is wrong youre beautiful then why do you look sad we have to be more

expect ill have to before this is over youre mine im yours promise me im yours and you are mine still no word weve sent a dozen ravens none have returned my bastard is only a few days from winterfell once he captures the castle  theon has my brothers i took the great castle of winterfell with  men you were a terrible baby do you know that if we storm the castle  he wouldnt dare hurt the boys theyre his only hope of escaping the north with his head send word to your son any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes a touch of mercy is a virtue your grace too much any ironborn with the exception of theon greyjoy he betrayed our cause he betrayed me and we will hunt him down no matter where he runs i expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer bawling all the time never sleeping your pardon my lord your grace my lady how are you how am i ive had to arrest my mother the lannisters have my sisters the man i considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers im fighting a war and i dont know if i should march south or north im sorry it was a stupid question im sorry and one night you just wouldnt shut up no forgive me youre being kind i have no right  you have every right youre a king thats not the kind of king i want to be what kind do you want to be i dont know the good kind most kings grew up as princes screaming like a dying pig they spend their whole lives preparing for the crown i was raised to be lord of winterfell i was raised to be a proper little lady to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite valyrian poetry id like to hear you play the harp no no you would not how did you go from reciting valyrian poetry to sawing off mens feet when i was my mother and father went to a wedding i walked over to your crib i looked down at you weddings in volantis last for days you know and they left me with my little brother the second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the threeyear summer we couldnt bear to be inside so we ran down to the rhoyne every child in volantis was in the rhoyne that day the rich the poor we were all there naked screaming racing to the little islands drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank i was treading water talking to a friend i wanted to strangle you when i realised i hadnt seen my brother i called his name then i started screaming his name and then i saw him floating face down my heart just stopped i was i dragged him from the water my friend helped me i think i dont even remember and you looked up at me and you stopped screaming he was so little then we pulled him onto the riverbank and i screamed at him and i shook him and he was dead just dead a man ran over he had a fish tattoo on his face in volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them and this man worked on a fishing boat you smiled at me and he pushed me out of the way you have to understand for a slave to push a highborn girl thats death for the man a terrible death but he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brothers chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the rhoyne and cried out and the man cradled his head and told him to be calm i decided two things that day dont die so far from the sea i would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies and when i came of age i would never live in a slave city again im sorry your grace you told me of your problems and ive blathered on i dont want to marry the frey girl i dont want you to marry her but you needed that bridge i hope its a very beautiful bridge the sour cherries was all crushed up and ready ive brought you a present lord of bones shut up probably in the piecrust by now in the oven the nice warm oven shut up what did you bring the cheese could be better i did get some nice sausages what did he want us to do about those guards he didnt say he just said walk through the gates what about the guards youre a great warrior i already got one crow dont need two he didnt say anything about the guards what he left that bit out its a pretty important part dont you think we have to trust him trust him you trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran i want to go back to the kitchens  shut up stay here if youre afraid arry dont away mance will want to question this one reset if the wind holds well reach kings landing in a day will it hold cant make promises for the wind your grace again pull i admire you ser davos i thank you your grace pleased to hear it some highborn fools call you onion knight and think they insult you so you take the onion for your sigil sew it on your coat fly the onion flag knows all about where the crows are and what theyre planning my son wishes me to change it three mermen with tridents something like that i understand why the older families look down at me do you why my father was a crabber  and well sons of lords dont like to break bread with sons of crabbers our hands stink and where were those lords when storms end starved many fought bravely for your brother many fought for the mad king the halfhand knows more this one is just a little boy you defend these men who insult you behind your back some are happy to do it to my face we were forgotten robert and ned stark they were the heroes the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle liberating towns from the yoke of the mad king while i held storms end with  men no one has forgotten your grace  no robert did he gave storms end to renly after the war renly never fought a day in his life he was only a boy  then whyd he give him storms end gut him first we ate the horses we werent riding anywhere not with the castle surrounded we couldnt feed them so fine the horses then the cats never liked cats so fine i do like dogs good animals loyal but we ate them then the rats the night before you slipped through i thought my wife was dying she couldnt speak any more she was so frail and then you made it through the lines slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions he could have killed me half a dozen times and potatoes some salted beef i believe every man in storms end wanted to kiss you that night i was relieved they did not robert told me to hold storms end so i held it then he told me he was giving it to renly so i gave it up insult or no i gave it up because robert was my older brother and he was the king and ive always done my duty but now im the rightful king by every law of westeros and when i sit the iron throne youll be my hand and now he wishes he did your grace i pray i serve you well i expect youll be the first crabbers son to wear the badge youre the master of whisperers youre supposed to know everything no man can be in all rooms at all times i have many little birds in the north my lord but i havent heard their songs since theon greyjoy captured winterfell the stark forces are distracted now is the time to strike to strike my dear nephew you do see these men preparing the walls for siege gut him you do understand stannis baratheon sails this way if my uncle stannis lands on the shores of kings landing ill ride out to greet him a brave choice your grace im sure your men will line up behind you they say stannis never smiles ill give him a red smile from ear to ear imagine stannis terror i am trying hes a bastard of winterfell ned starks son youre an intelligent man id like to think im an intelligent man oh no one disputes that my lord not even the multitudes who despise you i wish we could converse as two honest intelligent men i wish we could too what do you want tell me if were going to play youll have to start my brother was the youngest kingsguard in history my sister became queen at the age of mance will want him when i reached manhood my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in casterly rock a most highborn plumber the water never flowed better and all the shit found its way to the sea i never expected to have any real power so when my father named me acting hand youre quite good at being hand you know jon arryn and ned stark were good men honourable men i saw the bodies above your gates what does mance want with a dead mans bastard but they disdained the game and those who played you enjoy the game  i do last thing i expected and you play it well id like to keep playing it if stannis breaches the gates the game is over they say he burns his enemies alive to honour the lord of light the lord of light wants his enemies burned the drowned god wants them drowned why are all the gods such vicious cunts i dont know where is the god of tits and wine in the summer isles they worship a fertility goddess with  teats we should sail there immediately this morning i heard a song all the way from qarth beyond the red waste daenerys targaryen lives a girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems she has three dragons but even if what they say is true itll be years before they are fully grown i think hell want to decide for himself and then there will be nowhere to hide one game at a time my friend careful khaleesi xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you i found one a ship with a good captain she leaves for astapor tomorrow astapor we cannot stay here they have my dragons a mother does not flee without her children he runs ill chop his balls off theyre not your children i know they call you the mother of dragons and i know you love them but you didnt grow them in your womb they didnt suckle at your breast they are dragons khaleesi and if we stay in qarth well die you should sail to astapor im sure youll be safe there you know i would die for you i will never abandon you im sworn to protect you to serve then serve me he runs ill do it meself if my dragons are in the house of the undying then take me there thats what the warlock wants he told you so himself if you enter that place you will never leave again his magic is strong  and what of my magic you saw me step into the fire you watched the witch burn what did the flames do to me do you remember until my last breath i will remember after i have forgotten my mothers face they are my children were even now jon snow and they are the only children i will ever have take me to them we should bury them id leave em up a few more days sends a message if they havent got the damn message yet a few more days wont help as you say but it dont hurt to let em rot a while longer whats this  gold for the farmer for his trouble his troubles are done i couldnt do it hes feeding the crops now his wife too you want to keep a man silent you silence him got as far as the farm and then doubled back walked through the stream to throw off the hounds hoped this would be the last place theyd think to look youre right so far who was that out there hung up at the gates must have been the farmers boys i had the sword on her neck i just couldnt he killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords they mustnt know bran would blame himself theyll never hear it from me the little lads have suffered enough i know the others which one gave you the tougher fight the cripple or the sixyearold when you didnt come back we went looking for you we found your tracks fast enough but they found us before we found you they died because of me see that it wasnt for nothing all right up lad come on on your feet now move it is she beautiful ive never met her i treated the stark boys with honour and they repaid me with treachery whats her name frey i suppose i dont know her first name im sure youll be very happy and youre marrying her for a bridge an important bridge  ah it was before they killed my father i still thought i could march south and rescue him in time but only if i crossed that bridge when i speak to people from the north they all loved your father ,5346

drink before the war shall we ive always hated the bells they ring for horror a dead king a city under siege a wedding  exactly podrick is that it is that it nice touch when the sun rises stannis will sit on the iron throne as if you dont know the name of every boy in town im not entirely sure what youre suggesting im entirely sure youre entirely sure what im suggesting do you trust him oddly enough i do good the map you asked for there must be  miles of tunnels beneath the city closer to the targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and you will be his hand and to provide escape if necessary im not escaping strange as it sounds im the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down i go with her that is good to hear though im sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat you look well suited for battle my lord well im not for all our sakes i hope you are wrong my little birds tell me gods be good  god that stannis baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from asshai what of it you dont believe in the old powers my lord blood spells curses shapeshifting what do you think i think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen you probably dont entirely trust me mmm dont take it personally i dont entirely trust myself and yet i have seen things father there is only one and he watches over us and heard things things you have not things i wish i had not i dont believe ive ever told you how i was cut no i dont believe you have one day i will the dark arts have provided lord stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door for a man in service to such powers to sit on the iron throne i can think of nothing worse and tonight but not over them  over all of us i believe you are the only man who can stop him theyre welcoming the new king ive never known bells to mean surrender they want to play music with us lets play drums  drums remember wait till the ships the ships are in the bay they must be far enough in  i know what in means do you know how to use that  i chopped wood once no i watched my brother chopping wood the people of kings landing did not choose the false king joffrey baratheon i saw you kill a man with a shield youll be unstoppable with an axe dont get killed  nor you my friend oh are we friends now  of course we are just because i pay you for your services doesnt diminish our friendship

youll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard a king doesnt discuss battle plans with stupid girls our ships outnumber theirs to im sorry your grace youre right im stupid of course youll be in the vanguard they say my brother robb always goes where the fighting is thickest and he is only a pretender your brothers turn will come then you can lick his blood off hearteater too some of those

his king has asked him a question the king has asked you a question ser lancel tell the hound to tell the king that the hand is extremely busy the hand of the king would like me to tell you to tell the king if i tell the hound to cut you in half hell do it without a second thought that would make me the quarterman it just doesnt have the same ring to it those walls have never been breached cut me in half and i wont be able to give the signal no signal no plan no plan and stannis baratheon sacks this city takes the iron throne puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere it might be quite amusing except that my head would be up there too ive never much liked my head but i dont want to see it removed just yet where are their ships it was wise to attack at night we took them by surprise and the men guarding the walls lord varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago there are no surprises here if its true there is dissension in their ranks maybe their sailors have mutinied maybe i dont know why she wants me here shes always saying how stupid i am she hates me maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else i doubt it maybe shes jealous of you when they

doors the lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups i have faith in the lord of light the battles first traitors have ser ilyn see to them put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning the only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy remember that if you ever hope to become a queen

queen if my wretched brother should somehow prevail these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them lifted their spirits i dont have a choice in all this and if the city should fall youd like that wouldnt you the red keep should hold for a time long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to lord stannis in person if it were anyone else outside those gates i might have hoped for a private audience but this is stannis baratheon id have a better chance of seducing his horse have i shocked you little dove tears arent a womans only weapon but its not your war the

love didnt just happen to us we built it slowly over the years lord petyr baelish step forward stone by stone for you for your brothers and sisters for all of us its not as exciting as secret passion in the woods but it is stronger it lasts longer and that is what would be in store for me with one of walder freys daughters what you and father had  why not because shes not beautiful because shes not exotic and exciting now youre arguing just to argue because you arranged it for your good service and ingenuity and you agreed to it you gave him your word treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same if your father lived his life for one thing my father is dead and the only parent i have left has no right to call anyone reckless you said you saw my victory in the flames i

gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive and for what attacked from behind by tywin lannister and the tyrells if you see so much in your flames why didnt you warn me the lord of light

lives here lord stark went out of his way to make it your home yes my captors were so very kind to me you love reminding me of that everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me

kill that man i swear to the drowned god the old gods the new gods to every fucking god in every fucking heaven i will kill that man theon listen to me i serve winterfell now winterfell is yours im

served as commander of the city watch briefly im sure you filled your pockets and now my pockets are empty youve given me a taste for the finer things and if you want me protecting you youll need to pay more i thought we were friends we are but im a sellsword i sell my sword i dont loan it out to friends as a favour brother crow  crow how much  double double im a knight now knights are worth double i dont even know how much im paying you now which means you can afford it here here help me who are you i was in the battle at blackwater look over there i was a captain and a knight aye ser

at dragonstone will you take me there there is nothing for me at dragonstone this war is not over not for you maybe but for salladhor saan the war is over were both sworn to king stannis crow look over here look i am sworn to no man i promised you  ships and you promised me riches and glory i delivered the ships stannis never gives up never now he will regroup hes a broken man his fleet lies at the bottom of blackwater bay they say he sees no one not his generals not even his wife only the red woman whispering in his ear telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive look crow coming what they built a great fire when stannis returned all those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness they say she sang to them as they burned im a pirate youre a smuggler servants of darkness im thinking dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid take me back there please you cannot turn stannis against her maybe not but i could carve her heart out crow you could try if you fail they will burn you if you succeed theyll burn you and youve only just come back to life stay alive a little longer my friend you call me friend you drank with me on my wedding day and you drank with me on four of mine but i dont ask you for favours i have to stop her please do this for me when you are dead youre wearing the wrong colour i will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck we should set the siege lines  yards from harrenhal there wont be a siege the mountain cant defend a ruin the mountain will defend whatever tywin lannister tells him the lannisters have been running from us since oxcross id love a fight the men would love a fight i dont think were going to get one two hundred northmen slaughtered like sheep the debt will be repaid my friend mance was a ranger for them and for your sons will it they rot in the ground while their killer runs free the kingslayer wont remain free for long my best hunters are after him a mallister ser jeremy my fathers bannerman find her a chamber that will serve as a cell shes your mother in your hearts all you crows want to fly free she freed jaime lannister the lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice water water this needs to be cleaned and closed whats your name friend qyburn youre lucky to be alive lucky when im free will i be free to go the badge looks good on you almost as good as it looked on me are you enjoying your new position am i enjoying it i was very happy as hand of the king yes i heard how happy you were you brought a whore into my bed it wasnt your bed at the time i sent you here to advise the king i gave you real power and authority did you send the ravens crow  crow you chose to spend your days as you always have bedding harlots and drinking with thieves occasionally i drank with the harlots what do you want tyrion why does everyone assume i want something cant i simply visit with my beloved father my beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield sure you will maester pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal i organised the defence of this city while you held court in the ruins of harrenhal i led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson the king quivered in fear behind the walls i bled in the mud for our family and as my reward i was trundled off to some dark little cell but what do i want a little bloody gratitude would be a start jugglers and singers require applause and ill be free to kill you you are a lannister do you think i demanded a garland of roses every time i suffered a wound on a battlefield hmm now i have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion so tell me what you want i want what is mine by right jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles but he is a kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance got no respect this lot the day jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to casterly rock i am your son and lawful heir you want casterly rock it is mine by right well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of blackwater bay and when the time is right you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy got no fathers to slap them when theyre foul and if you serve faithfully you will be rewarded with a suitable wife and i would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to casterly rock why why you ask that you who killed your mother to come into the world you are an illmade spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colours what happened to their fathers since i cannot prove that you are not mine and to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him but neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn casterly rock into your whorehouse go now speak no more of your rights to casterly rock go some of them were killed by crows like you one more thing the next whore i catch in your bed ill hang dorne its going to dorne why dorne its carrying silk and its supposed to bring back wine in exchange but its not coming back the captains tired of risking his life so kings landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve dont look so grim jon snow hes going to stay in dorne wait out the winter where its beautiful and warm i met some people in dorne who werent so beautiful and warm dont ruin the game i told you i dont want to play what about that one there that one its going to volantis why because when i got on a ship in volantis it looked like that one thats not how the game works if mance rayder likes you youll live another day youre not supposed to just blurt out the right answer youve got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why why should i make up a story when i know the truth because the truth is always either terrible or boring lovely day for it watching the ships lord baelish might i speak with lady sansa alone for a moment i saw your mother not long ago shes very eager to see you and if he dont and your sister aryas alive you said youd take me home you said kings landing was your home you are the property of the crown stealing you would be treason if you were to tell just one person i wont tell anyone how do i know because im a terrible liar you said so yourself tarly look at me i smell a crow please lord baelish tell me what to do tell me when im waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital when i set sail i might be able to take you with me but youll need to be ready to leave on a moments notice youre her handmaiden yes and youre his i help manage his affairs hes an important person so is she i grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle we killed his friends thought youd want to question this one the day she was born they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset

growing fast what do we want with a baby crow not fast enough i cant wait that long i need an army well be in astapor by nightfall some say the unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world the

21,2,8.6,3,dont think too much bran hodor did you ever tell him no of course not you werent renlys type im afraid he preferred curlyhaired little girls like loras tyrell youre far too much man for him im not interested in foul rumours unless theyre about me its all true about renly his proclivities were the worst kept secret at court its a shame the throne isnt made out of cocks theyd have never got him off it were you inside the wolf again little lord shut your mouth i dont blame him and i dont blame you either we dont get to choose who we love where are you headed then south you  riverrun staying off the kings road are you they get you no matter where you go you cant win no you really cant no it was the threeeyed raven looks like youre safe enough meaning no offence my lady but i

than lady starks daughters make it tighter here hes back mmm thats better it makes you look very strong no flowers i said no flowers all these are wrong bring others yes your grace bloody flowers on the king looks like a tyrell rose give it to margaery for her wedding gown should be more than enough fabric tell me what you think of her i tried to kill it but i couldnt who margaery shes an ideal match with the tyrells beside us well crush the northerners hang their lords burn their strongholds sow their fields with salt and no one will think of rebelling for another century it is a good match but what do you think of her shes beautiful and intelligent yes she is her concern with the wellbeing there was a boy  i dont want to hear about it of the common people is interesting not to me i only meant to go out of your way to endanger this is becoming one of the most boring conversations ive ever had margaery tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason she dresses like a harlot for a reason married a traitor and known degenerate like renly baratheon for a reason she married renly baratheon because she was told to thats what intelligent women do what theyre told but you asked  weve got plenty of worries you need to ask yourself i dont need to do anything better much better i still dont believe it he didnt want anything he just takes an interest because he loved my mother men only want one thing from a pretty girl littlefingers not in love with me love is not the thing he wants we dont need to pour black magic on top of them hes too old they never see it that way he didnt ask you to do something for him spy on someone or no if he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you i want you to tell me why what will you do i will make him stop ser loras tyrell my lady i didnt ask for black magic dreams send him in lady sansa ser loras my sister invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the lady olenna in the gardens may i escort you to them i believe

fit to be king renly was brave and gentle grandmother no one knows were alive father liked him and so did loras loras is young and good at knocking men off horses with a stick that does not make him wise as to your fathead father grandmother what will sansa think of us she might think we have some wits about us one of us at any rate it was treason i warned them robert has two sons and renly has an older brother how can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair we should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me and who told you that but once the cows been milked theres no squirting the cream back up her udders so here we are to see things through what do you say to that sansa shall we have some lemon cakes lemon cakes my favourite so weve been told are you going to

maester luwin said if he made it through the night hed live but it would be a very long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breaths his coughing his whimpering which boy jon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i couldnt bear to look at him i didnt want to see those brown never strangers eyes staring up at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer id condemned this poor innocent child to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he didnt even know so i prayed to all seven gods let the boy live not until i met the king of the grim bearded stinking barbarians let him live and ill love him ill be a mother to him ill beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us and he lived and he lived and i couldnt keep my promise and everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family pardon me your grace its all because i couldnt love a motherless child was it hard for you to kill the halfhand yes you liked him i like you but if youre

follow it west to riverrun my mother grew up there my grandfathers a lord hell protect us could be a minstrel  shut up a minstrels got gold sometimes we could jump him tie him up steal his gold and buy some food shh before boltons bastard got to winterfell the ironborn were gone and so he spoke and so he spoke that lord of castamere but now the rains weep oer his hall with no one there to hear whats lurking behind that wall a lion a wolf just a dirty little cub i think loose a few more shafts  dont put the sword down girl you go on down the road keep singing so we know where you are leave

the mountain were looking for theyll bring us back and put rats in us youve got nothing to fear from us the lords of westeros want to burn the countryside they may have escaped were trying to save it now come on well talk more over brown bread and stew and then you can go on your way heres the thing fat boy when im done talking that arrows falling down on your fat head so i advise you move because im done talking half the countrys starving and look at this one maybe hes the reason half the countrys starving my lion weve spoken of this you cant kill it you know or theon may have taken them to the iron islands as hostages you cannot come here but you said i should come to you with any problems did anyone see you no  you sure my father does not make idle threats having you killed would be the high point of his week you have to be absolutely certain all right what is this problem im worried about sansa when she spoke with lord baelish have you received any demands his friend warned me about him baelish doesnt have friends i dont know her name oh ros the redhead how do you know her i try to know as many people as i can you never know which one youll need shes a whore yes well we shouldnt be judgemental about these things you fucked her no oh please all right yes i fucked her once twice but since i met you my lady ive been with no one else and was she good did you like her not as much as i like you obviously or shed be the one torturing me right now what did she say about littlefinger that sansa shouldnt trust him is there an idiot in any village who trusts littlefinger have you heard anything from theon at all we have to protect her we cant now that the lannisters have discarded her sansa will have many suitors a great beauty with a very old name a great beauty oh a great beauty yes she is objectively very her face is quite pleasing to other men and to women people in general but not to me of course i only have eyes for you where am i you pervert you want her this child i dont even want to talk about her but you are only because youre making me i didnt force you to open your mouth and make words come out this is cruel and unfair cruelly unfair aw the cruelty shae is so cruel to me mmm yes who are you now do you think im cruel only if you stop but you mustnt come here again do you hear me youve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people dangerous people mmm lady tyrell my king send her in you wanted to see me your grace im leaving on a hunting trip what do you want i just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before i left thats very thoughtful your grace i have everything i could want good good how are you finding life in the capital it must be quite a change after renlys camp a welcome one a military encampment is no place for a lady and the bedside of a traitor is that a place for a lady i want to do this your grace i tried to do my duty as a wife that is all what was your duty to this traitor as you saw it the duty of any wife to any husband to provide him with children you failed to do this why  i i would not speak ill of the dead you think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor cause he had a sword put through his heart no i do beg your pardon do you know how long itll take to get to kings landing the subtleties of politics are often lost on me renly i dont believe he was interested in the company of women what makes you say this whenever i wanted to make a child with him he he had so many excuses so many latenight war councils he never wanted to try except one evening after hed had far too much wine to drink he suggested something something that sounded very painful walking through fields and forests and couldnt possibly result in children maybe the fault was with me no he was a known degenerate its such a relief to hear you say so your grace mmm ive considered making his perversion punishable by death as is your right you must do whatever you need to do you are the king yes why not yes i am do you like it i just had it made probably one of the finest weapons in the seven kingdoms its beautiful will you show me how it works its a new design much easier to load theres no crank you use this lever to draw the string the bolt goes here and then you just aim and how shall we pass the time would you take me hunting sometime forgive me your grace i know a hunt is no place for a woman its not unheard of my father would never let me before you no longer belong to him do you want to hold it may i please i imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there could you do it by putting one foot in front of the other could you kill something i dont know your grace do you think i could yes would you like to watch me yes stop stop tell us the truth about what i dont know what you want i want the truth its going to be a very dull walk what truth whyd you take winterfell i took it to i took it who gave the orders  no one i took it on my own  why to take the north while vulnerable and once you took it hold it rule it good thats very good why did you do that i told you im here to take you to kings landing why did you take winterfell i took it to bring glory to my house and my father wait wait wait wait i took it because i hated the starks i hated them for holding me prisoner i wanted to hurt them what are you doing please ill tell you anything just take it off please please just take it off your sister sent me  yara ill come for you tonight when the castle sleeps and bring back lady starks daughters in exchange no dont go please please no please dont leave me please please please please dont go please please dont leave me please dont go rickon stay with us its all right the wolves will protect him you can get inside his head see through his eyes only when im asleep thats how it begins until you learn to control it youre a warg dull is fine its not just wolves sometimes in my dreams theres a a threeeyed raven youve seen it we saw him together you havent forgotten does it have anything to do with warging no the raven is something different something deeper the raven brings the sight seeing things that havent happened yet or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away you know it doesnt matter how loyal a servant you are whats he telling him why dont you ask isnt he ashamed your brother needing you to protect him wheres the shame in that any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting some people will always need help that doesnt mean theyre not worth helping when my father died i dreamt it you didnt dream it you saw it so did i no one enjoys the company of a humourless mute you have the sight too when i told my father about your father for the first time in my life i saw him cry your father is howland reed yeah he saved my fathers life during the rebellion your father told you about the rebellion mine never did but i saw that too what else have you seen only one thing that matters trust me on this you i never liked the skinny ones like drinking from a puddle not that im averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again i dont drink ale theres no story so good a drink wont make it better yeah  you see theyve suffered through my bouts of sobriety its very tedious for all concerned now how did three children were not children because the raven is you people have been serving me since i was born how did three young persons such as yourselves untrained in the art of war escape from harrenhal gendrys a smith he was apprenticed in the armoury a smith eh whered you train kings landing tobho motts shop that criminal he charges twice as much as every other armourer in the city thats because hes twice as good  ahha a smith and a salesman gendry stole us weapons  ah you think lady stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank fought your way out of harrenhal i see he knows how to use a sword and so do i my brothers taught me ooh to your brothers you can finish your meals before you go it may be awhile before you see another youll free us i gave you my word but before you go following her around for the rest of her life allow me to raise a cup to your hey hey now that is an uncommonly large person how does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person one waits for him to drink until he passes out poor man you have my sympathy aha not a man at all a hound so good to see you again clegane a weeks journey with you and shell order you to fall on your sword thoros the fuck you doing here drinking and talking too much same as ever a pretty prize lads yeah girl what in seven hells are you doing with the stark bitch its a tough decision take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water silence if lady stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service anyone can see us on the bridge but cross by water and the current could take us or i could escape down the river good luck its wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas which will she choose gambler at heart wouldnt have guessed be quick about it oh i need to rest  get up i have these on your feet when you walk too far im sure shell let me know shes an honest woman what do you call them  get up now corns i never used to get corns i used to ride everywhere not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year this heel is ruined theres no way i never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords ooh you move well for a great beast of a woman for all the good its done her you shouldnt grimace before you lunge it gives away the game bit of a quandary for you if you kill me you fail lady stark but if you dont kill me im going to kill you youre good graceless but good see if you were willing to hurt me you might have had me there looks like your womans getting the better of you if you can call that a woman we enjoy a good fight gets our juices flowing the flayed man of house bolton a bit gruesome for my taste how did you come into lady starks service you sure hes the one thats him all right i saw him fight at the tourney for ser willem freys wedding give the man his silver let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want enough to buy me a new head if the king in the north hears i let the kingslayer go hell be taking it right off id rather he takes yours theres something we can talk about not your concern kingslayer hodor it had to be recently you werent with her at winterfell how would you know because i visited winterfell i would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways move were you pledged to stannis  gods no ah renly really he wasnt fit to rule over anything more important than a course meal shut your mouth  why its all right hodor i lived with him at court since he was a boy dont forget could hardly escape the little tulip skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks i knew him better than you i knew him as well as anyone as a member of his kingsguard he trusted me with everything he would have been a wonderful king

kings landing after the sack khaleesi you know what i saw butchery babies children old men more women raped than you can count theres a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand but the unsullied are not men they do not rape brothers greatgrandsons they do not put cities to the sword unless theyre ordered if you buy them the only men theyll kill are those you want dead you disagree ser barristan when your brother led his army into battle at the trident men died for him because they believed in him because they loved him not because theyd been bought at an auction i fought beside the last dragon on that day i bled beside him rhaegar fought valiantly rhaegar fought nobly no and rhaegar died did you know him well ser barristan i did your grace finest man i ever met i wish i had known him but he was not the last dragon all did this ones ears mishear your grace they did not i want to buy them all she wants to buy them all she cant afford them the slut thinks she can flash her tits and make us give her whatever she wants how many men did you lose there are  unsullied in astapor is this what you mean by all yes  and the ones still in training as well if they fail on the battlefield they will shame astapor master greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys if they fail on the battlefield they will bring shame upon all of astapor i will have them all or take none many will fall in battle ill need the boys to pick up the swords they drop but for every man we lost the lannisters the slut cannot pay for all of this master kraznys says you cannot afford this her ship will buy her  unsullied no more your ship will buy you  unsullied and this because i like the curve of her ass because master kraznys is generous what is left will buy her the gold you have left is worth i will give her  if it stops her ignorant whimpering but good master kraznys will give you we need our men more than tywin needs his her dothraki smell of shit the dothraki you have with you but may be useful as pig feed the dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed i will give her  for those but master kraznys will give you three unsullied for all of them so ask this beggar queen master kraznys asks how you propose to pay how will she pay for the remaining why dont you shut your mouth about that damned mill im sorry for the remaining  unsullied i have dragons

be master kraznys gift to me a token of a bargain well struck she asks that you give me to her as a present she asks that you do this now khaleesi a dragon is worth more than any army aegon targaryen proved that youre both here to advise me i value your advice but if you ever question me in front of strangers again you would have youll be advising someone else is that understood do you have a name this ones name is missandei your grace do you have a family a mother and a father youd return to if you had the choice no your grace no family living you belong to me now it is your duty to tell me the truth yes your grace lying is a great offence many of those on the walk of punishment were taken there for less right here today at this gathering if you had been patient i offered water to a slave dying on the walk of punishment do you know what he said to me let me die there are no masters in the grave your grace is it true what master kraznys told me about the unsullied about their obedience all questions have been taken from them they obey that is all once they are yours they are yours they will fall on their swords if you command it and what about you you know that im taking you to war you may go hungry you may fall sick we seem to be running short of patience here you may be killed valar morghulis yes all men must die but we are not men a surprising place to keep the royal ledgers im surprised youre surprised this is the safest place in the city not for bastards thats all of them my lord thank you my dear pod you know who isnt pod take them outside ill be there in a moment yes my lord i hear you owe that boy a significant debt only my life not all that significant im afraid you should have him knighted if only the master of coin had such power if only i owe you a significant debt our redheaded friend tywin lannister you secured her release when the queen detained her oh that of course a simple misunderstanding apparently her grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship we dont i did fuck her once i know  but we dont i know howd the queen get that idea why dont you ask her intimate lovely table any advice for me on my new position keep a low profile if i had a gold dragon for every time i heard that joke id be richer than you are well you are richer than i am good point theyre only numbers numbers on paper once you understand that its easy to make them behave trivial even you want a real challenge try whores ive tried quite a few well lots of work to do enjoy the eyrie better chairs than the old small council chamber come on im here later come on tonight then looks like dull reading you think all reading is dull reading its an opinion i share with some of the finest men i know the secret history of the seven kingdoms is in these pages unless lord twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what hes really up to unless he made it all up yes podrick do keep up conveniently close to your own quarters i like it yes my lord podrick yes my lord after a long consultation with my colleague ser bronn i finally found a suitable reward for the services youve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable tell me pod have you ever been with a woman no my lord wonderful genna specialises in firsttimers and dont call him nephew he is your king what news of jaime shes not bad with secondtimers either uh my lord a fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my wouldbe killers face wouldnt you say now as it happens marei is quite the spearhandler herself shes here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me hes handsome unwashed northerners have known about his escape for weeks you didnt tell me he was handsome kayla is famous from here to volantis in certain circles one of four women in the world who can perform a proper meereenese knot my lord i dont even shes here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow whos never once failed to address me as my lord be back in time for my supper pace yourself lad for years ive heard that littlefinger is a magician whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together you control more spies and informants and poof mountains of gold let me guess hes not a magician no hes stealing it worse hes borrowing it whats wrong with that we cant afford to pay it back thats whats wrong with it the crown owes millions to my father seeing as its his grandsons ass on the throne i imagine hell forgive that debt than the rest of the world combined forgive a debt my father for a man of the world youre strangely naive ive never borrowed money im not clear on the rules  well the basic principle is i lend you money and after an agreed upon period of time you return it with interest what if i dont well you have to but what if i dont this is why i dont lend you money do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is anyway its not my father im worried about its the iron bank of braavos we owe them tens of millions if we fail to repay these loans the bank will fund our enemies one way or another they always get their gold back ah the return of the conquering hero does he have a little jaunt in his step the lads practically skipping you were gone a long time i trust you got your moneys worth we are trying my lord or should i say my moneys worth oh it was a gift podrick this is more than i give you in a year hes a squire you dont pay him oh then its much more than i give you in a year they wouldnt take it my lord maybe theyre trying to curry some favour with the new master of coin have you ever known a whore to turn down gold they were happy enough to take it when i gave it to them what did you tell them i didnt tell them anything try harder what did you do to them lots of things and they seemed to like these things yes my lord of course they did theyre paid to seem to like it only they werent paid what are you saying these ladies enjoyed him so much they gave him the time for free is that what youre telling us sit down podrick what do we have then were going to need details copious details come on come on come on come on you know how we deal with runaways take off his pants no no no no no im gonna fuck you into the dirt no please no no no no dont no please no no robb stark and most of his bannermen are in riverrun you little bastard come my lord youre a long way from home and winter is coming ill take the big bitch first when shes good and wet you lot can finish her off my lord i am brienne of tarth lady catelyn stark commanded me to deliver ser jaime to kings landing catelyn starks a treasonous cunt orders were to take the kingslayer alive nobody said shit about you for the funeral of his grandfather lord hoster tully youre only making it worse take her over there where its dark id like a little privacy come on you know who she is dont you a big dumb bitch from who cares where never been with a woman that big shes brienne of tarth her father is lord selwyn tarth heard of tarth im gonna cut your throat they call it the sapphire isle do you know why robb knows i meant him no in starks absence roose bolton holds harrenhal every sapphire in westeros was mined on tarth sapphires are gemstones the blue ones i know what they are lord selwyn would pay his daughters weight in sapphires if shes returned to him but only if shes alive her honour unbesmirched bring her back here yes my lord get up which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal come on come on on your feet unbesmirched not defiled fancy word for a fancy man i hated to read as a child but my father forced me to study every morning before i could practise with sword or horse two hours every day holed up in the maesters chambers i learned a lot of fancy words in practice not in name i bet you did your father hed pay your weight in gold to get you back youll be a rich man till the end of your days and your sons will be rich men and their sons after them lands titles youll have them all the north cant win this war youre a smart man you understand that we have the numbers we have the gold aye you have both let him have it fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding hard to argue with that now that were speaking together man to man i wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree im not asking to be freed from my constraints but if i could sleep lying down my back would thank you for it im not as young and resilient as i was once none of us are the name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble unchain ser jaime from the tree come on men suppose youll be wanting something to eat im famished actually i think weve got a spare partridge on the fire well i do like partridge bring the bird over here and the carving knife will this work as a table my lord oh yes yes this will do on the stump the lord of harrenhal will make you think youre the smartest man there is that everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots my father and if you get in any trouble all youve got to do is say my father and thats it all your troubles are gone dont have you got something to say careful you dont want to say the wrong thing youre nothing without your daddy and your daddy aint here a worthy suitor for the widow arryn never forget that here this should help you remember for which i am extremely grateful to you my lord lady arryn and i have known each other since we were children she has always been positively predisposed toward me youre lucky im not your king a successful courtship would make lord baelish acting lord of the vale titles do seem to breed titles youll leave for the eyrie as soon as possible and bring lysa arryn into the fold then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him far be it from me to hinder true love but lord baelishs absence would present certain problems the royal wedding may end up being i wouldnt let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag the most expensive event in living memory summer has ended hard days lie ahead not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended fully agreed which is why im naming you new master of coin master of coin it would appear to best suits your talents im quite good at spending money but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it my blunder sent tywins mad dog i have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge hear hear he lifted her high in the air he sniffed and roared and smelled her there she kicked and wailed the maid so fair but he licked the honey from her hair from there to here from here to there all black and brown and covered with hair he smelled that girl on the summer air the bear the bear and the maiden fair ,4481
23,4,9.6,3,how many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass if i die you wont be getting howd that turn out for us he had no way of knowing we do now we know whats out there crasters been out here surviving so hes your new protector now our good friend craster were like the sons he never had mormont isnt gonna save you this lummox here isnt gonna save you when the walkers come calling craster will serve us up like so many pigs if we want to live oh enough well have to look out for ourselves you woke him im sorry hes beautiful  shh hes beautiful does he have a name  no are you going to give him one why here  gilly you said to hold it for you until you came back here youre back  i wanted you to have it i dont want your stupid thimble i want to save my babys life can you do that can you i dont have time for you i dont have time for anyone but him because he doesnt have much time you have to go after him how you know how cant say that ive ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast brandon mother  how many times have i told you no climbing mother i need to find it its here its calling me i want you to promise me no more climbing promise me promise me promise me mother mother promise me bran promise me is he very large stop no larger than usual apparently and yet they said that he was extraordinary the most extraordinary man theyve ever had and theyve had a lot of men were talking about the same podrick the quiet boy in lord tyrions service seems a bit simple what did he do to them i dont know my lord the girls are usually quite descriptive so what did they say far enough they said it was hard to describe huh prodigies appear in the oddest of places and what did littlefinger say about this loss of income he was too preoccupied to notice hes leaving for the eyrie soon im helping him prepare for his journey ah yes to pursue his enduring love of the lady arryn and the title that comes with her sad really do that again and ill take your other hand is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa stark he hasnt spoken to her since the last time as far as i know hmm but i dont think hes lost interest what makes you say so his shipboard inventory you can read rare for a woman in your profession former profession  of course im missing something obvious youre about to point out come on you two featherbeds hes bringing two featherbeds for the cabin who is important enough to littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides littlefinger could he be bringing one of his girls hes not interested in them my lord how do you know because im one of his girls prodigies in odd places indeed rhaenyra targaryen was murdered oh lord tyrion come in come in by her brother or rather his dragon it ate her while her son watched whats left of her is buried in the crypts right down there the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum which seats  comfortably there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else there arent more than  people of any importance no the rest are there to look adoringly upon the to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats i hope we might speak in confidence over there in that urn the ashes of aerion targaryen aerion brightflame they called him he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon he was wrong and of course theres the mad king killed by my uncle would you like to see where the last targaryens are buried are you sure lady margaery doesnt find all this a bit macabre no its quite all right your grace id love to see their tombs really its like taking a walk through history depends if hes had any practice oh always in confidence the tombs just up here this is so exciting you were married here your grace yes must seem like only yesterday hmm seems like a lifetime ago your husband was buried here as well no he wanted his remains returned to storms end such a tragedy a fairly predictable tragedy about the events of the blackwater hunting and drinking dont mix i should say not my sons a hunter it helps him forget hes never been within a mile of a real battle i seem to recall he laid siege to storms end for the better part of a year all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent i told him to stay out of roberts rebellion he had no business fighting an actual warrior we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave but they do seem to yearn for it perhaps this is the wrong time we shower them with good sense and it slides right off like rain off a wing and yet the world belongs to them a ridiculous arrangement to my mind the gods have seen fit to make it so my father didnt want them here he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the blackwater but the high septon convinced him otherwise im glad he did im sorry your grace oh no its a wonderful time i know they did terrible things at the end but their ancestors built this sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness i couldnt agree more shall we go and see them if you give them your love they will return it a thousand fold ive spoken with them i know how they feel about you you led the defence of kings landing they adore you open the doors i thought one of your little birds might joffrey wait lady margaery  lady margaery bless you lady margaery lady margaery lady margaery margaery long live lady margaery king joffrey king joffrey have knowledge of my sisters intentions to king joffrey king joffrey king joffrey gods bless king joffrey how far is it to deepwood motte not far my lord your sister is waiting for you there she sent you to save me  yes i served them the men who were torturing you i did what they told and waited end your life why would you risk your life for me i grew up on saltcliffe my lord i was only a boy when they took you away my father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off i remember the look on my fathers face when he told us thats balon greyjoys last living son and those are the words i heard over again when i saw what they were doing to you those men they said my father knew what they were doing to me i didnt inherit littlefingers spies did he i dont know my lord they they never told me much my sisters men are loyal to her we dont need to hide from them not all those are your sisters men some of them are loyal to your father hmm what is it i was just thinking how jealous i was when my father told yara to take this place along with his position im afraid what did he tell you to do raid fishing villages he didnt trust me thought i was a stark i could never be a stark robb stark always reminded me of that he lorded it over you didnt have to all he had to do was be be who he was born to be his life fit him better than his clothes which is why im coming to you i need proof how could someone like that ever be a brother to me hes the king in the north and me my father gave me a choice and i made it i could never be a stark but ironborn thats what i was born to be i paid the iron price for winterfell i murdered those boys the stark boys never found them that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for proof  will there be a trial just some poor orphans living with a farmer i let dagmer slit their throats and i let him burn the bodies so i could keep winterfell and make my father proud maybe its not too late it is my real father lost his head at kings landing i made a choice and i chose wrong and now ive burned everything down i need to know not everything my lord shes up here yara  shh wait i brought him back he he killed the others what no i didnt you cant no please stop no put him back where he belongs i have no proof only whispers eat what are you doing im dying you cant die you need to live to take revenge i dont care about revenge you coward a little misfortune and youre giving up misfor misfortune before all this nastiness you lost your hand my sword hand i was that hand you have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit you sound like a bloody woman i know what you did for me you told them tarth was full of sapphires its called the sapphire isle because of the blue of its water i was going to tell you the story of how i was cut you knew that why did you help me you wanted to speak to me yes about jaime what about him i wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back when catelyn stark took tyrion prisoner what did i do in response you started a war do you want to hear it still and if i would start a war for that lecherous little stump what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir whatever you can whatever i can youre still here yes why did it ever occur to you that i might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust i dont know do i not your sons not jaime or tyrion but me years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture really just with tiny tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them living by them that she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children all right contribute the tyrells are a problem as a boy i travelled with a troupe of actors through the free cities the tyrells helped us defeat stannis baratheon the tyrells saved your life your childrens lives margaery has her claws in joffrey she knows how to manipulate him good i wish you knew how to manipulate him i dont distrust you because youre a woman i distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are youve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes one day in myr i will do you like it nana another golden rose how original i eat from plates stamped with roses i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring dear growing strong ha the dullest words of any house a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse winter is coming now thats memorable we do not sow strong strong those are houses you watch out for direwolves and krakens fierce beasts but a golden rose growing strong that strikes fear in the heart look little loves a spider in the garden run along now grow strong my lady she loosened you up for us i feared the man meant to use me i wanted to personally welcome you to kings landing the city has been made brighter by your presence the city is made brighter by my presence is that your usual line lord varys are you here to seduce me a little obvious perhaps oh no please seduce away its been so long though i rather think its all for naught what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit a question for the philosophers but youve come mincing all this way for something as id heard some men used small boys so  might i sit no come ive heard youre such a clever man im curious why youve sought me out youve taken an interest in sansa stark have i because i spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you why shouldnt i shes an interesting girl is she no not particularly but what he wanted was far worse but shes had an interesting childhood she has sadly well forgive me for wasting your time then i thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing come come you surrender rather easily walk with me i know the walls have ears but apparently the shrubbery does too i choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still which is sansa stark neither a babe in the woods he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak i admired her father yes ned stark had many admirers and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head i could not help lord stark perhaps i can help his daughter how youre not the only one who has taken an interest in her thats hardly surprising shes a beautiful girl with a famous name indeed shed make a lovely match for the right suitor it almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point yet did nothing to dull my senses littlefinger is not long for the capital a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes sansa stark goes with him and why have you come to me with this matter littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies he has acquired the first two how long before he has the army perhaps youll laugh but i know him better than most and this is the truth littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in westeros if robb stark falls sansa stark is the key to the north with a hooked blade he sliced me and if he marries her hell have the key in his pocket which seems such a shame why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride you must despise him youre working so hard to undermine him actually i rather enjoy him but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes you are a clever man lord varys you are too kind i believe i have a possible solution root and stem chanting all the while one doesnt need to be clever for that its obvious isnt it i didnt mean to disturb you you havent wed like some privacy please if you wouldnt mind waiting back inside the keep or if youd be kind enough to give me your names ill ask the king to speak with you himself what did you pray for i cant tell you why not he burned my parts in a brazier ill tell you what i prayed for in the sept this morning lets see for my familys health and happiness for an end to the war for a short winter boring and traditional im afraid and you im sorry i just cant my cousin alanna was the most beautiful girl id ever seen when i was  i was all elbows and knees and alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me pig face she called me pig face thats ridiculous the flames turned blue and i heard a voice answer his call it had something to do with my nose whenever she passed me in the halls shed oink so i prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease a week after that she came down with porridge plague porridge plague oh you dont have it in the north your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony but thats awful youre i still dream of that night i believed you porridge plague im an idiot dont say that no youre not so what happened to alanna oh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea its all terribly frustrating im sure shes jealous of you now youll be married here in the capital hes going to fall not of the sorcerer not of his blade and shell have to come watch and pretend to be happy that youre queen i want us to be friends good friends that would make me very happy you must see highgarden youd love it there i know you would we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon you should see the costumes people work on them for months uh i dont think the queen would let me leave kings landing the queen regent you mean once i marry joffrey ill be queen and if you were to marry loras i dream of the voice from the flames your place would be at highgarden wouldnt it we would be sisters you and i would you like that his name was bannen he was a good man a good ranger he came to us from where did he come from down white harbor way he came to us from white harbor never failed in his duty he kept his vows the best he could was it a god a demon a conjurors trick he rode far fought fiercely we shall never see his like again and now his watch has ended and now his watch has ended didnt think a broke foot could kill a man it wasnt his foot that killed him that bastard craster starved him to death crasters got his daughters to feed you on his side we cant just show up and steal all his food i dont know were brothers of the nights watch not thieves the day we leave craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow hes a bloody wildling never knew bannen could smell so good you have one son dont you mormont i had my th you ever meet a man with  sons and more daughters than i can count but the sorcerer called and a voice answered im glad for you are you now me ill be glad when you and yours have gone as soon as our wounded are strong enough ah theyre as strong as theyre gonna get them thats dying why dont you cut their throats and be done with it or leave them if

a hand in planning it naturally no let go of me let me go its shaping up to be a very involved affair the word extravagant has been used what good is the word extravagant if it cant be used to describe a royal wedding i understand that  good but as master of coin it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown as of now its a huge expense and and were at war lady olenna cast your light upon us looks like their god likes me more than your butchers boy oh id nearly forgotten and maintaining supply lines i cant think how it slipped my mind what is it  infantrymen the tyrell family has supplied mounted lances  in support provisions so this city might survive the winter a million bushels of wheat half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye head of cattle  sheep you dont have to lecture me about wartime expenses burn in hell im quite familiar with them and we are grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm as is a royal wedding the people are hungry for more than just food they crave distractions and if we dont provide them theyll create their own and their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces a royal wedding is much safer wouldnt you say he will i would and traditionally paid for by the royal family i was told you were drunk impertinent and thoroughly debauched imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper where did you go for them volantis my lady  oh very well i wont have it said that house tyrell refuses to play its part well pay for half and the celebrations will go on as planned is that sufficient  quite thank you but not today very good then thats settled good day give me that what are you doing just mending lord berics armour why im going to stay and smith

many times five i think no this makes six six there was the first time the mountain show her lance right through the chest then i was stabbed in the belly then it was an arrow in the back which three and that axe in the side then the lannisters caught me and executed me for treason was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye both fuckers couldnt decide and the hound makes six second time ive been killed by a clegane youd think youd learn its not getting any easier you know i know every time i come back castle black im a bit less pieces of you get chipped away could you bring back a man without

strings cut help me out of these rags now get out theres another tub this one suits me fine dont worry im not interested if i faint pull me out i dont intend to be the first lannister to die in a bathtub why should i care how you die you swore a solemn vow remember youre supposed to get me to kings landing in one piece or does he just flop dead to the ground not going so well is it no wonder renly died with you guarding him that was unworthy forgive me you protected me better than most  dont you mock me im apologising im sick of fighting lets call a truce you need trust to have a truce i trust you there it is theres the look ive seen it for  years on face after face hes no crow you all despise me kingslayer oathbreaker a man without honour youve heard of wildfire of course the mad king was obsessed with it he loved to watch people burn the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones he burned lords he didnt like he burned hands who disobeyed him just cause you want him inside you dont make him one of us he burned anyone who was against him before long half the country was against him aerys saw traitors everywhere so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city beneath the sept of baelor and the slums of flea bottom under houses stables taverns even beneath the red keep itself finally the day of reckoning came robert baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the trident im not afraid of you but my father arrived first with the whole lannister army at his back promising to defend the city against the rebels i knew my father better than that hes never been one to pick the losing side i told the mad king as much i urged him to surrender peacefully but the king didnt listen to me he didnt listen to varys who tried to warn him but he did listen to grand maester pycelle that grey sunken cunt strike this man down if he is guilty i like you boy you can trust the lannisters he said the lannisters have always been true friends of the crown so we opened the gates and my father sacked the city once again i came to the king begging him to surrender he told me to bring him my fathers head then he turned to his pyromancer burn them all he said burn them in their homes burn them in their beds tell me if your precious renly commanded you to kill your own father but if you lie to me ill pull your guts out through your throat and stand by while thousands of men women and children burned alive would you have done it would you have kept your oath then first i killed the pyromancer and then when the king turned to flee i drove my sword into his back burn them all he kept saying burn them all i dont think he expected to die he meant to burn with the rest of us a thousand men and rise again reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash i slit his throat to make sure that didnt happen thats where ned stark found me if this is true why didnt you tell anyone why didnt you tell lord stark stark you think the honourable ned stark wanted to hear my side well find out soon enough he judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me by what right does the wolf judge the lion by what right  help help the kingslayer jaime my name is jaime onion knight ser onion knight princess gods what are you doing here shh youll wake bert bert hes the fat one hes on guard duty tonight i dont need you to protect me

we cant why not what will they do lock us in cells i wouldnt know where to start  at the beginning this word is aegon when you see a e and g together like that it sounds like egg and the title of the whole book is an history of aegon the conqueror and his conquest of westeros it was a bitch of a siege  mmm who vouched for you with mance you were first through the breach at pyke the second thoros of myr went in alone waving that flaming sword of his thoros of myr bloody madman robert knighted you after the battle proudest moment of my life one knee in the dust the kings sword on my shoulder listening to the words in the name of the warrior i charge you to be brave all i could think of was how badly i had to piss it seems you owe me a debt in full plate metal for  hours never occurred to me till the fighting was over i was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots robert would have laughed he was a good man a great warrior and a terrible king i burned away my years fighting for terrible kings you swore an oath  yes and a man of honour keeps his vows give it back even if hes serving a drunk or a lunatic just once in my life before its over i want to know what its like to serve with pride to fight for someone i believe in do you believe in her with all my heart these are the ones yes khaleesi the officers you did not choose this life but you are free men now and free men make their own choices give strength to his sword if he is true well i stole it have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks remove your helmet this one has the honour what is your name grey worm grey worm all unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut grey worm red flea black rat names that remind them what they are vermin its mine if you want it come steal it back from this day forward you will choose your own names you will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same throw away your slave name choose the name your parents gave you or any other a name that gives you pride grey worm gives me pride it is a lucky name the name this one was born with was cursed that was the name he had when he was taken as a slave but grey worm is the name this one had the day daenerys stormborn set him free ygritte king robert wanted her dead of course he wanted her dead shes a targaryen the last targaryen i suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him i didnt sit on the small council no doesnt the lord commander of the kingsguard traditionally traditionally yes but i killed a dozen of roberts friends during his rebellion he didnt want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the mad king ygritte cant say i minded much i always hated the politics yeah i imagine i would too hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over mmmhmm still shell have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms shell have good men around her to advise her men with experience which men do you have in mind ygritte seven hells forgive me for what im about to say but your reputation in westeros has suffered over the years it suffered for a reason i sold men into slavery i dont know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home our cause forgive me ser barristan but i was busy defending the khaleesi against king roberts assassins while you were still bowing to the man we both want her to rule am i wrong ygritte you only joined us a few days ago i cant speak to your intentions if were truly her loyal servants we will do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride youre not lord commander here youre just another exile and i take my orders from the queen come to bed you were right the karstarks are gone is orell right are you still a crow almost half our forces tywin lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel nothing only wait dont let him what can i do attack kings landing theres nothing hed like better hed crush us in a day we could ride

for riding here so quickly i know travel isnt easy in these times no no no  not very well the roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits when the king of the north summons us we come our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met lord frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters of course he deserves as much i was in the wrong as restitution for this betrayal he demands harrenhal and all its attendant lands i dont think thats sing me a song we are fighting for the north harrenhal is not in the north it is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it and theres something else we will do whatever we can to give lord frey what he needs not what whom what uh no our father requires lord edmure to wed one of his daughters roslin how old is she oh all right lets see nineteen could i see her first you want to count her teeth we depart for the twins in the morning we need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end your father does realise were in the middle of a war father is old it will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband oh and his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements he has every right to be please excuse us while we discuss it why should i let that old ferret choose my bride for me at the very least i should be offered the same choice you were im his liege lord hes a proud man and weve wounded him i didnt wound him my answer is no listen to me and listen very carefully you the laws of gods and men are very clear the fathers face is stern and strong no man can compel another man to marry the laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth its all right you heard him if you refuse our alliance with the freys is dead hes wanted me for one of his daughters since i was hes not gonna stop wanting it now when i say no he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing youre willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife he sits and judges right from wrong i have a war to fight we cant win it without them i have no time to haggle you said you wanted to make amends for the stone mill you recall that heroic engagement i had something less permanent in mind ive won every battle but im losing this war if we dont do this and do it now were lost ill marry her youre paying for my sins uncle its not fair or right ill remember it he weighs our lives the short and long i see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear yes most kind of them youre a stark bannerman lord bolton i am acting on lady starks orders to return jaime lannister to kings landing when king robb left harrenhal his mother was his prisoner if she wasnt his mother hed have hanged her for treason i should send you back to robb stark you should but instead youre sitting here watching me fail at dinner take off that big log and loves the little children why might that be wars cost money many people would pay a great deal for you we both know who would pay the most or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution youre right perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies it would be if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it king robb is keeping your father quite busy the mother gives the gift of life he doesnt have time for anything else hell make time for you as soon as youre well enough to travel i will allow you to go to kings landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made and you will swear to tell your father the truth that i had nothing to do with your maiming shall we drink on it i dont partake you do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people and watches over every wife very well my lady may our journey continue without further incident oh she wont be going with you i am charged with bringing ser jaime to you are charged with abetting treason im afraid i must insist youre in no place to insist on anything i would have hoped youd learned your lesson about overplaying your position impossible  why her gentle smile ends all strife my grandson is the pride of highgarden the most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms your daughter  is rich the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king old old old im something of an expert on the subject her change will be upon her before long and she loves her little children ill spare you the details of what will happen then you may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter but this is another matter entirely the years punish us as well i promise you that my stomach remains quite strong however the only thing that might turn it are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities do you deny them oh not at all a swordswallower through and through thats not how you skin a rabbit a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name did you grow up with boy cousins lord tywin sons of your fathers bannermen squires stable boys of course and you never no not once not in any way never i know how to skin a rabbit i congratulate you upon your restraint but its natural boys having a go beneath the sheets perhaps highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behaviour i wouldnt say that true we dont tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery but brothers and sisters where i come from that stain would be very difficult to wash out i will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it not by the looks of it lie or not you must admit many people find it quite convincing convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill lannisters and tyrells thanks to our new affiliation i dont care what people believe and neither do you as an authority on myself i must disagree now if the rumours about my children were true then joffrey is no king at all you grow up north of the wall and house tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt and if cersei is too old to give loras children were throwing another prized flower into the dirt it is a chance we simply cannot take the uncertainty makes you uncomfortable all right ill remove it for you if you refuse to marry loras to cersei i will name him to the kingsguard im sure youre familiar with the kingsguard vows you learn the proper way to handle game he will never marry he will never have children ah the tyrell name will fade and highgarden will go to the children of joffrey and margaery you would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you i would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously so shall i draw up the order or do you consent to this match its a rare enough thing a man who lives up to his reputation ah i didnt see any game before i got here no weve gotta cut them loose no take my hand thats a wonderful pin its more of a brooch really though i suppose a brooch is a sort of pin so im very happy about yes i am as well i feel like im in a dream if i had a bow i could have shot a dozen yes me too definitely ive dreamed of a large wedding since i was young the guests the food the tournaments and the bride of course the most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves have you ever been to highgarden my lady no i had never left winterfell before i came to kings landing but it sounds wonderful i cant wait to see it well i made this bow myself and to leave this place its terrible isnt it the most terrible place there is i dont suppose theres anything we can do about this we can have them both killed its hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement probably sansa though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery father doesnt discriminate guess you dont learn how to do that north of the wall were all being shipped off to hell together on a boat you built the tyrells were plotting to undermine our family i did what i did to protect our family im your family a member of your family who has actively contributed to that familys survival whether or not you or father or anyone else wants to admit it i do admit it if it werent for your trick with the wildfire you learn how to use your fists stannis would have sacked the city before father got here our heads would still be rotting on the city gate trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you there are two people in kings landing who can give an order to a kingsguard did you or did you not order ser mandon to kill me during the battle of the blackwater the impulse i understand he hates me because im the only one who tells him what he really is oh youre gonna punch the rabbits to death so fair enough he wants me dead but his stupidity he could have had me poisoned and no one would have known but the king orders a kingsguard to murder the hand of the king in full view of his own army the boys an idiot what do you want me to say i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger probably but not from joffrey he wont do anything now fathers here seven kingdoms united in fear of tywin lannister i had someone else in mind not the tyrells soon they wont need to be afraid of him joffrey will belong to margaery the little doeeyed whore and so will his children and their children history will be taken from our hands you may escape at least once jaime gets back ser loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels when jaime gets back yes but when will that be hes out there somewhere well someone else is sitting right here jaime or not im truly fucked whos going to tell her do you think people will like it i dont think they will even notice it youre right its not my wedding anyway from what i can tell the dressmakers in highgarden will be far superior to the ones in kings landing theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding loras likes green and gold brocade youre both very good at skinning rabbits im sure he does will they let me invite my family they havent asked my opinion but do you think they will no lady sansa lord tyrion to see you should i i beg your pardon my lady good afternoon lord tyrion i was trying on a gown for joffreys wedding yes it should be quite a wedding some of us are just a little better i need to speak with you lady sansa of course alone if i may why do you need to speak to her alone shae please excuse her shes not from here but i trust her even though she tells me not to sometimes we think we want to hear something and its only afterwards when its too late that we realise we wished wed heard it you know your fires well some of us would say thank you under entirely different circumstances its all right really how to begin its this this this is awkward a thousand blades taken from the hands of aegons fallen enemies forged in the fiery breath of balerion the dread there arent  blades there arent even when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them ive counted im sure you have ugly old thing yet it has a certain appeal the lysa arryn of chairs shame you had to settle for your second choice early days my friend it is flattering really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what i want thwarting you has never been my primary ambition i promise you or dont they teach you to say thank you north of the wall although who doesnt like to see their friends fail now and then youre so right for instance when i thwarted your plan to give sansa stark to the tyrells if im going to be honest i did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there but your confidant the one who fed you information about my plans the one you swore to protect youve got a big mouth girl and too many teeth you didnt bring her any enjoyment and she didnt bring me any enjoyment she was a bad investment on my part luckily i have a friend who wanted to try something new something daring and he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience i did what i did for the good of the realm the realm do you know what the realm is its the  blades of aegons enemies stop it  hmm a story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that its a lie but what do we have left once we abandon the lie chaos a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all chaos isnt a pit chaos is a ladder many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again the fall breaks them and some are given a chance to climb but they refuse they cling to the realm or the gods or love hodor  youve been fighting since you met illusions only the ladder is real the climb is all there is just stop it lady reed heres got a stick so far up her ass its a wonder her feet touch the ground youve been nasty to her every day of course shes nasty back someone built your fires for you growing up me its my fault first time i met her she put a knife to my throat first time i met you you held a knife at me we cant fight each other well never make it to the wall i want you both to make peace your way of skinning rabbits is quicker i said so didnt i osha youre a good little hunter thank you see not so hard is it it doesnt get so cold down in the reach thank you  dont push me im right here with you whats happening im right here with you whats wrong with him the visions take their toll hes having one now i saw jon snow you saw him at castle black he was on the wrong side of the wall and there were servants of course surrounded by enemies used to be you couldnt find a tree within a mile of the wall crows would come out every morning with axes your flock gets smaller every year you ever climbed it before no but tormunds done it half a hundred times youre afraid arent you aye ,4274

youre beautiful and fierce and wild id be good to you you love him cause hes pretty is that it you like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes you think pretty is gonna make you happy dont touch me its a great honour to carry your house sigil you wont love him so much when you find out what he really is growing up at winterfell all i ever wanted was to escape to come here to the capital see the southern knights and their painted armour and kings landing after dark all the candles burning in all those windows im stupid a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns come on and the drummers is that a great honour too come walk with me i remember the first time i saw you in the throne room id never seen anyone who looked so unhappy i want very much for you to be happy sansa and so does my grandmother you would have been happy at highgarden but women in our position must make the best of our circumstances how do i make the best of my circumstances i have to marry him has lord tyrion mistreated you no has he been kind to you usually its the young boys banging the drums hes tried you dont want him though hes a lannister far from the worst lannister wouldnt you say im sorry here i am complaining to you my son will be king sons learn from their mothers i plan to teach mine a great deal and your son if im not mistaken your son might be the lord of casterly rock and the north someday what so what good are they my son with him ill have to well have to if its the pain youre worried about im not afraid of the pain not after what joffreys done to me what is it then hes rather goodlooking even with the scar especially with the scar hes a dwarf and loras they help the men march loras some women like tall men some like short men some like hairy men some like bald men gentle men rough men ugly men pretty men pretty girls most women dont know what they like until theyve tried it and sadly so many of us get to try so little before were old and grey tyrion may surprise you from what ive heard hes quite experienced and thats a good thing it can be were very complicated you know pleasing us takes practice how how do you know all this did your mother teach you yes sweet girl my mother taught me shes a child shes a foot taller than you a tall child whats the youngest youve ever had not that young how much older older well its youre a lord shes a lady and a beauty at that i dont see the problem shae isnt going to like it shae is a whore are you gonna marry her eh how did marrying a whore work out for you the first time i should never have told you about that you want shae keep her wed one and bed the other all you have to do is get a son in the stark girl hell be lord of winterfell one day its the rhythm you can rule the north in his name youll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them you waste time trying to get people to love you youll end up the most popular dead man in town you want to fuck that stark girl you just dont want to admit it i dont pay you to put evil notions in my head the ones already there dont need company you pay me to kill people who bother you about a week i think oh you mean right foot left foot evil notions come free your grace grandfather you wanted to speak to me yes id like a report on the meetings of my small council youre welcome to attend the meetings of your small council your grace any or all of them ive been very busy right foot left foot right foot many important matters require a kings attention of course youve been holding the council meetings in the tower of the hand instead of the small council chamber i have yes may i ask why well the tower of the hand is where i work to walk from there to here would take time time i could otherwise spend productively so if i wanted to attend a council meeting what you need help remembering that i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand we could arrange to have you carried tell me about the targaryen girl in the east and her dragons where did you hear about this is it true apparently so dont you think we ought to do something about it when i was hand of the king under your fathers predecessor the skulls of all the targaryen dragons were kept in this room the skull of the last of them was right here when mance gives the signal and we hit castle black it was the size of an apple and the biggest was the size of a carriage yes and the creature to whom it belonged died  years ago curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us but how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counselling the king on matters about which he knows nothing but i havent been counselled we wont be banging on drums to let them know were coming you are being counselled at this very moment i should be consulted about such things from now on i will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary your grace yunkai the yellow city the yunkish train bed slaves not soldiers we can defeat them on the field with ease but they wont meet us on the field they have provisions patience and strong walls no if theyre wise theyll hide behind those walls and chip away at us man by man i dont want half my army killed before ive crossed the narrow sea we dont need yunkai khaleesi taking this city will not bring you any closer to westeros or the iron throne how many slaves are there in yunkai if not more then we have  reasons to take the city no youre just gonna light the biggest fire send a man to the city gates tell the slavers i will receive them here and accept their surrender otherwise yunkai will suffer the same fate as astapor now comes the noble razdal mo eraz of that ancient and honourable house master of men and speaker to savages to offer terms of peace noble lord you are in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen queen of the andals and the first men khaleesi of the great grass sea the north has ever seen to let them know youre coming breaker of chains and mother of dragons you may approach sit will the noble lord take refreshment ancient and glorious is yunkai our empire was old before dragons stirred in old valyria many an army has broken against our walls you shall find no easy conquest here khaleesi good my unsullied need practice i was told to blood them early if blood is your desire blood shall flow you know nothing jon snow but why tis true you have committed savageries in astapor but the yunkai are a forgiving and generous people the wise masters of yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen there is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship my ship  yes khaleesi as i said we are a generous people you shall have as many ships as you require and what do you ask in return all we ask is that you make use of these ships shes right you dont sail them back to westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace i have a gift for you as well your life my life and the lives of your wise masters but i also want something in return you will release every slave in yunkai every man woman and child shall be given as much food clothing and property as they can carry you think i know you cut me loose on the wall as payment for their years of servitude reject this gift and i shall show you no mercy you are mad we are not astapor or qarth we are yunkai and we have powerful friends friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you those who survive we shall enslave once more perhaps well make a slave of you as well you swore me safe conduct  i did but my dragons made no promises and you threatened their mother cut her loose too do you see her sulking about it take the gold my gold you gave it to me remember and i shall put it to good use youd be wise to do the same with my gift to you now get out the yunkish are a proud people they will not bend and what happens to things that dont bend he said he had powerful friends who was he talking about i dont know find out thats because she understands the way things are chains solid gold from the mines outside lannisport smithed in casterly rock golden chains you could buy a ship with these do i need a ship  what

narrow sea what would i do there juggle i am a lannister of casterly rock the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird and im shae the funny whore my feelings for you have not changed i will

deal with her eunuchs we only have to deal with her shes wellguarded tonights a new moon one of us slips into her camp past her unsullied and her knights where do you think im taking you which one of

disappoint you my lord no dont you dont have to speak to me as a prisoner any more you wont be a prisoner after today youll be my wife i suppose thats a different kind of prison i just wanted to say im just trying to say very badly i just just want to say i know how you feel thats the red fork im taking you to the twins i doubt that very much my lord youre right i have no idea how you feel and you have no idea how i feel but i promise you one thing my lady i wont ever hurt you do you drink wine when i have to well today you have to you look radiant your grace radiant why radiant its the word that came to mind but why were going to be sisters soon we should be friends youre a musical girl arent you i imagine you have a lovely voice a better dancer than a singer im afraid but you know the song the rains of castamere of course they play it so often here at court so you know the story of house reyne of castamere not as well as you im sure house reyne was a powerful family very wealthy the second wealthiest in westeros your mother and brother will be there and theyll pay me for you arent the tyrells the second wealthiest family in westeros now ambitious climbers dont want to stop on the second highest rung if only you could take that final step youd see further than all the rest youd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you so lord reyne built a castle as grand as casterly rock he gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore and finally one day he rebelled against my father do you know where house reyne is now gone why would they be at the twins gone a gentle word why not say slaughtered every man woman and child put to the sword i remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of casterly rock my father let them rot up there all summer it was a long summer and now the rains weep oer their halls and not a soul to hear if you ever call me sister again ill have you strangled in your sleep what are you doing but if i live ill break both your hands those outlaws you love so much never told you your fathers gone as the father of the realm it is my duty to give you away to your husband you may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection uh could you thank you your grace your grace my lords my ladies we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife the whole countryside is yapping about it one flesh one heart one soul now and forever have you ever seen one like it ive never seen anything like any of this not in my life its shocking isnt it the first time you encounter real wealth when i was your age i lived on one bowl of stew a day and stew is a kind word for it in flea bottom we called them bowls of brown wed pretend that the meat in them was chicken we knew it wasnt chicken here taste this your uncle is marrying one of the frey girls you think im trying to poison you thats good thats really good where do you think its from i couldnt even guess doesnt matter does it its the real thing or its not you only need a tongue to tell the difference go on have some more you still dont trust it you think this is all a mistake so quit trying to bash my skull in that you have to pay for every bite you take that thought had crossed my mind yeah there are no mistakes not for us im a mistake im only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern your father chose your mother because the lord of light willed it he willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you cant even begin to understand and we might just make it there in time for the wedding and he brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world were both a part of his plan he wants this for us no he demands this of us i dont understand this this doesnt seem very religious according to whom the silent sisters with their stern looks muzzled mouths and driedup cunts what have their gods done for you mmm men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty when you pray to them whats their answer a god is real or hes not you only need eyes to see death is coming for everyone and everything a darkness that will swallow the dawn and we can stop it you and i let me show you what you have inside you come fight death with me what are you doing you have to trust me they cannot be trusted what get it away get it off me dont fight dont fight they wont take much why are you doing this i told you theres power in the blood of kings and you have so much blood no no no no no not there not there they can be trusted to kill you if theyre well paid you can blame ser davos he didnt believe in the power of kings blood he wanted a demonstration please please your grace my lord the usurper robb stark the usurper balon greyjoy the usurper joffrey baratheon so their son will be your nephew after youre wed to cersei of course and you will be the kings stepfather and brotherinlaw the yunkish are paying them well when you marry the king joffreys mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be loras nephew grandson im not sure but your brother will become your fatherinlaw that much is beyond dispute will you pardon me my lord of course of course enjoy perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead ive got a lifetime for that stay you know these men you seem rather drunk rather less than i plan to be isnt it a mans duty to be drunk at his own wedding this isnt about your wedding renly baratheon had a wedding your wife needs a child a lannister child as soon as possible and if youre going to give her one you need to perform what did you once call me a drunken little lustfilled beast go on hit me only by the broken swords on their banners more than once  there you have it nothing to worry about drinking and lust no man can match me in these things i am the god of tits and wine i shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel i visit you can drink you can joke you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable but you will do your duty well theyre called the second sons my father once told me nobody cares what your father once told you congratulations my lady thank you your grace well youve done it youve married a lannister soon youll have a lannister baby its a dream come true for you isnt it what a glorious day yes your grace i suppose it doesnt really matter

it then youll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock what did you say what did you say i believe we can dispense with the bedding your grace im sure tyrion did not mean to threaten the king a bad joke your grace hes a dangerous man khaleesi they all are made out of envy of your own royal manhood mine is so small my poor wife wont even know im there your uncle is clearly quite drunk your grace i am guilty but but it is my wedding night my tiny drunk cock and i have a job to do come wife how many i vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act not proud of it but i think honesty is

enough to make a difference i could i wont but your father if my father wants someone to get fucked i know where he can start i wont share your bed not until you want me to what if i never want you to and so my watch begins nineteen yes your grace how can anyone speak  languages its hard to collect wages from a corpse it only took your grace a year to learn dothraki reasonably well yes well it was either learn dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope what do you mean reasonably well dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master so guttural and harsh drogo said i spoke dothraki like one born to it it gave him great pride athjahakar athjahaka im sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side athjahakar athjahakar well i suppose im a bit out of practice your high valyrian is very good your grace the gods could not devise a more perfect tongue it is the only proper language for poetry no screaming or she dies what do you want you let her go hit me hard i imagine youre right dont scream lovely girl you were sent here to kill me so why havent you i dont want to what do your captains have to say about that you should ask them why we had philosophical differences over what your beauty id like to talk to the titans bastard about winning it meant more to me than it did to them youre a strange man im the simplest man youll ever meet i only do what i want to do and this is supposed to impress me yes why would i trust a man who murders his comrades they ordered me to murder you i told them i preferred not to they told me i had no choice i told them i am daario naharis i always have a choice he may not agree to meet they drew their swords and i drew mine will you fight for me swear to me the second sons are yours and so is daario naharis my sword is yours my life is yours my heart is yours you really ought to knock i brought your breakfast its getting dark we could stay here for the night how hard can it be to build a fire it doesnt matter come under the furs we can keep each other warm he will he winked at me before i doubt it i saw him wink at me he blinked i suppose its a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink a what well i mean theres no real difference a wink is on purpose you thought of a name yet a man who fights for gold cant afford to lose to a girl it would be easier to refer to him if he had a name sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me what no this is just the way i talk ill build that fire dont you think he should have a name i dont know many boys names lets see theres duncan kevan jon guymon feldan tristifer your grace allow me to present craster uh yes maybe thats not mormont thats a lovely idea but mormonts a last name why is it a last name well its a family name for instance im samwell tarly samwell is my birth name and tarly is my family name you see so my father is also a tarly the captains of the second sons his name is samwell tarly too no randyll tarly randyll is a handsome name

men fight for the second sons under  your grace we have more dont we unsullied im only a young girl new to the ways of war but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us you dont want to be alone out here girl i hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie you have  unsullied youre very young to be a captain hes not a captain hes a lieutenant even if your numbers are right the odds dont favour your side the second sons have faced worse odds and won the second sons have faced worse odds and run or you could fight for me weve taken the slavers gold we fight for yunkai someone worse than me would find you i would pay you as much and more our contract is our bond if we break our bond no one will hire the second sons again ride with me and youll never need another contract youll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when i take back the seven kingdoms you have no ships you have no siege weapons you have no cavalry a fortnight ago i had no army a year ago i had no dragons you have two days to decide ,3720
28,9,9.9,3,are you sure about this now winterfell is burnt to the ground this is where we enter the city very few guards they know me they let me inside were not gonna sneak an army through a back gate i kill the guards i take your two best men and lead them through the back streets which i know well and open the front gates then comes the army once the walls are breached the city will fall in hours or perhaps youll lead grey worm and me to the slaughter the north is overrun with ironborn and bran and rickon are gone cutting the head off our army the masters of yunkai will pay you your fee and you wont have to split it three ways cause youve already slaughtered your partners you have a very suspicious mind in my experience only dishonest people think this way you command the unsullied what do you think you are a leader now do you trust him so casterly rock i trust him you leave tonight very good well prepare ser jorah you can use an extra sword youre the queensguard ser barristan your place is by the queen if we are truly her loyal servants well do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride were west of castle black im asking your advice but the nightforts closest to us it was the first castle on the wall the watch abandoned it during the reign of king jaehaerys i too big impossible to maintain other than castle black itself the nightforts the perfect castle for us its got a secret sally port the black gate as old as the wall itself no ones used it in centuries most likely it leads through the wall right down into the nightfort if one knows how to find it which it just so happens  i do we have enough men how do you know all that i read about it in a very old book you know all that from staring at marks on paper yes youre like a wizard our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the wall and lived here we are alive remember what happens to children who run if walder frey cooperates im your father and ill do the talking the roads have gone right to hell cracked three spokes this morning need a hand need about eight hands oh got to get this salt pork to the twins in time for the wedding many thanks dont dont kill him dead rats dont squeak if walder frey cooperates youre so dangerous arent you saying scary things to little girls killing little boys and old people a real hard man you are more than anyone you know youre wrong i know a killer a real killer  that so youd be like a kitten to him hed kill you with his little finger that him no  good if reinforcements arrive from kings landing before we take the castle dont kill him please please dont youre very kind someday itll get you killed where are we the gift i think brandon the builder gave all this land south of the wall to the nights watch for their sustenance and support maester luwin taught me that well be caught between tywins army and the sea doesnt seem to be supporting anyone at the moment its good land and theres no war up here why leave wildlings sorry but they come over the wall and raid steal carry off women old nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it thats what old nan said theres a storm coming well lose the war and die the way father died i dont see any its as good a place to shelter as any we can drink some blood while we wait i dont need much only one old man and eight good horses whats one old man doing with eight horses he breeds them for the watch hows he keep folks from stealing them the watch protects him not today they dont no or worse hes selling horses hes got some gold in there and proper steel lets carve him up we just take the horses and go the old mans no threat i keep telling you hes an old man a spear through the hearts a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear the watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief theyll send a lot more to hunt down murderers show them how it feels to lose what they love i hope so killing crows in their castle is tough killing them out here in the open thats what we do spread out surround the hut and move in ygritte clear the barn no ones going to believe youre a hog farmer if you eat them all best part of the animal dont worry theyre still there i know theyre still there you check every five minutes like youre afraid theyre gonna move my honoured guests im not afraid of course you are youre almost there and youre afraid you wont make it the closer you get the worse the fear gets no point in trying to hide behind that face i know fear when i see it seen it a lot i knew fear when i saw it in you youre afraid of fire when berics sword went up in flames be welcome within my walls and at my table you looked like a scared little girl and i know why too i heard what your brother did to you pressed your face to the fire like youre a nice juicy mutton chop that give you some ideas might do go ahead then you might get away might even make it there on your own theyre just over the river the closest youve been to family i extend to you my hospitality since ilyn payne snipped your daddys neck someday ill put a sword through your eye

rescue than any woman ive ever met be kind shes finally starting to like you and i like her but if she had her way i would be back in volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of roslin freys hand perhaps ive made a terrible mistake striking your king is an act of treason no dont waldina dont insult them your grace the septon has prayed his prayers some words were said and lord edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak but they are not yet man and wife a sword needs a sheath and a wedding needs a bedding what does my sire say to bed to bed to

to bed to bed poor girl fine every bride suffers the same im sure you endured yours with grace oh ned forbade it he said it wouldnt be right if he broke a mans jaw on our wedding night that is a very strange custom i suppose it does seem strange from a foreigners perspective it seems normal to you its a tradition without the bedding ceremony theres no real proof the lord and lady consummated their

29,10,9.2,3,go move out here comes the king in the north youre a fool if you believe hes the most powerful man in westeros a treasonous statement joffrey is king you really think a crown gives you power no i think armies give you power mmmhmm robb stark had one never lost a battle and you defeated him all the same mmmhmm oh i know ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall walder frey gets all the credit or the blame i suppose depending on your allegiance walder frey is many things but a brave man no he never would have risked such an action if he didnt have certain assurances which he got from me do you disapprove im all for cheating this is war but to slaughter them at a wedding ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall explain to me why it is more noble to kill  men in battle than a dozen at dinner so thats why you did it to save lives to end the war to protect the family do you want to write a song for the dead starks go ahead write one im in this world a little while longer to defend the lannisters to defend my blood the northerners will never forget good what are you doing let them remember what happens when they march on the south all the stark men are dead winterfell is a ruin roose bolton will be named warden of the north until your son by sansa comes of age i believe you still have some work to do on that score do you think shell open her legs for me after i tell her how we murdered her mother and brother one way or another you will get that girl pregnant i will not rape her i have a list shall i explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works use small words im not as bright as you the house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first a good man does everything in his power to better his familys position regardless of his own selfish desires does that amuse you no its a very good lesson a list of people you mean to kill only its easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when youre making all the decisions easy for me is it when have you ever done something that wasnt in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family the day that you were born i wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away instead i let you live and i brought you up as my son for laughing at me do i look like joffrey to you because youre a lannister sansa its empty lets find a place to sleep hodor hodor dont hodor maybe we shouldnt stay here youd rather be out there there are a lot of stories about this place no death seems a bit extreme horrible stories i always quite liked the horrible stories so did i once you ever heard about the rat cook no whos he just a cook in the nights watch he was angry at the king for something i dont remember when the king was visiting the nightfort the cook killed the kings son cooked him into a big pie with onions carrots mushrooms and bacon fear of death on the other hand that night he served the pie to the king he liked the taste of his son so much he asked for a second slice the gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young hes been roaming the nightfort ever since devouring his own babies but no matter what he does hes always hungry if the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat it wasnt for murder the gods cursed the rat cook or for serving the kings son in a pie he killed a guest beneath his roof you should learn to ignore them thats something the gods cant forgive the late walder frey old tully called me because i didnt get my men to the trident in time for battle he thought he was witty look at us now tully youre dead your daughters dead your grandsons dead your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and im lord of riverrun the blackfish escaped an old man on the run with no allies here comes the king in the north my lady people have been laughing at me i have tywin lannister backing me who does he have as you say they all laughed at me all those high lords they all thought they were better than me ned stark hoster tully people snigger when i marry a young girl but who said a word when jon arryn married the little tully bitch youll be needing a new young girl yeah far longer than theyve been laughing at you got that to look forward to hmm and you the warden of the north no more starks to bow and scrape

up there i heard the greyjoy boy seized the place i heard he killed all the ravens and after that nothing i sent my bastard ramsay to root him out robb stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us theon oh and ramsay delivered the terms youre a lannister the ironborn turned on theon as we knew they would they handed him over trussed and hooded but ramsay well ramsay has his own way of doing things well the girls werent lying you had a goodsized cock what no pork sausage you think im some sort of savage people talk about phantom limbs i am the disgraced daughter of the traitor ned stark an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be so ive always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock next time you think about naked girls will you feel an itch sorry i shouldnt make

was happy and no one can take that away from me not even joffrey how it feels to have someone someone of your own how long does it go on until weve dealt with all our enemies every time we deal with an enemy we create two more then i suppose it will go on for quite a long time show him im telling you thats what she did sounded like a cow in heat aye not for long thats right black walder shut her

brother a renowned pillowbiter so father disowned me today he cant disown you youre all hes got youre forgetting tyrion you dont really plan on staying in the kingsguard do you staying in the kingsguard means i live right here in the red keep with you not now  i want not now when ive been back for weeks somethings changed  everythings changed you come back after all this time with no

of the nights watch what do you call that he wanted me to kill him a bastard son of a traitor what would you expect the halfhand believed our only chance to stop mance was to get a man inside his army dont talk about the halfhand as if you knew him he was my brother then youd know hed do anything to defend the wall the free folk would have boiled him alive but letting me kill him the free folk listen to him supper would be nice he even talks like a wildling now aye i talk like a wildling i ate with the wildlings i climbed the wall with the wildlings i i laid with a wildling girl you admit to breaking your vows then i do the law is the law the boy must die if we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl the wall would be manned by headless men for  years ive tried to teach you theres a difference between sneaking off to the moles town brothel and sleeping with the enemy while we sit here debating which rules i broke mance rayder marches on the wall with an army of impossible you cant get  wildlings together before they start killing each other hes united the thenns the hornfoots the iceriver clans he has giants fighting for him giants if you havent learned by now you never

south of the wall already led by tormund giantsbane i killed their warg and three others they shot me full of arrows their orders are to attack castle black from the south when mance hits it from the north the signal for the attack will be a bonfire go mance said it would be the greatest fire the north has ever seen thats the truth all the truth do you intend to execute me or am i free to go none

to commemorate your generosity no your heartfelt thank you is its own reward i would imagine ill be hearing it again before long wars are rather expensive the iron bank will have its due how they love

poorest in his city youre an example to us all ser jaime im very sorry ser loras its quite all right your sister looks very beautiful what about your left as does yours so are you looking forward to

what about strength  yes strength king robert was strong he won the rebellion lord baelish  petyr and crushed the targaryen dynasty and he attended three small council meetings in  years he spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him so we have a man who starves himself to death a man who lets his own brother murder him and a man who thinks that winning and ruling

if you move your lips thats how children do it the life and adventures of elyo grivas first sword of braavos thank you very much money buys a mans silence for a time i like this one its full of swordfights and pirates you were a pirate once  no i was a smuggler whats the difference if youre a famous smuggler youre not doing it right my father says a criminal is a criminal your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behaviour so do the braavosi youve sailed to braavos  of course almost got beheaded by a first sword of braavos i tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers wheres sansa a bolt in the heart buys it forever but he didnt seem any more interested in the distinction than your father i suppose if you work for the iron bank of braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction what was that for  i need you to write a message you should write it yourself its good practice its too important for me i need a smart person to do it go on to the offices of the iron bank of braavos from stannis baratheon the one true king of westeros he was helping me because i saved his life but thats not you i need to get their attention go write hes seen some adventures hasnt he precious little thing  thank you whats his name  sam lovely that the daddy  no

the back and i cant run away which is what we did at crasters you have to trust me its for the best best for you the last legacy of house hollard oh gilly please dont greedy no im sorry youre lovely i just never acquired the taste youre calling my beauty an acquired taste thats quite all right lover theres more for you your loss you like them both the same boys and girls does that surprise you  everyone has a preference i had it made a few weeks ago then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure the gods made that and it delights me the gods made this and it delights me when it comes to war i fight for dorne when it comes to love i dont choose sides i hope i have as much stamina when im your age what are you children someday if youre lucky you will wake up and realise you are old what did i once tell you about the capital that pretty ass of yours will sag your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and grey hairs will sprout from your ears no one will want you any more make sure youve fucked your fill before that day did you he is a prince of dorne girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies they will all have to line up behind you prince oberyn  lord tywin were all liars here may we have the room call my name if you need me lover would you like to sit no thank you some wine  no thank you im sorry about your grandson are you i dont believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father or his grandfather an awful way to die come my lady which way is that are you interrogating me lord tywin some believe the king choked some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant the king was poisoned i hear you studied poisons at the citadel i did this is why i know your hatred for my family is rather wellknown you arrive at the capital an expert in poisoning some days later my grandson dies of poisoning i know youve had a difficult day rather suspicious why havent you thrown me in a dungeon you spoke with tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived what did you discuss  you think we conspired together what did you discuss the death of my sister for which you blame me she was raped and murdered by the mountain the mountain follows your orders of course i blame you find her bar the gates of the city seize every ship in the harbour but youre safe now here i stand unarmed unguarded should i be concerned you are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that i am a man of reason if i cut your throat today i will be drawn and quartered tomorrow men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors knowledge so you deny involvement in elias murder categorically i would like to speak with the mountain im sure he would enjoy speaking with you i promise you that he might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would i could arrange for this meeting but you want something in return there will be a trial for my son and as custom dictates three judges will render a verdict i will preside mace tyrell will serve as the second judge i would like you to be the third why not long ago the tyrells sided with renly baratheon youre safe with me declared themselves enemies of the throne now they are our strongest allies well you made the tyrell girl a queen asking me to judge at your sons trial isnt quite as tempting i would also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors i never realised you had such respect for dorne lord tywin we are not the seven kingdoms until dorne returns to the fold the king is dead the greyjoys are in open rebellion a wildling army marches on the wall sailing home and in the east a targaryen girl has three dragons before long she will turn her eyes to westeros only the dornish managed to resist aegon targaryen and his dragons youre saying you need us that must be hard for you to admit we need each other you help me serve justice to the kings assassins and i will help you serve justice to elias podrick apologies for the stench so am i the queen i brought you some wine my lord but they took it from me a noble effort they didnt find the candles though a quill some parchment duck sausage almonds and some hard cheese youre a good lad any word of shae ive heard nothing my lord i suppose thats a good thing more than you were with renly what are they saying about me out there youre to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king do you believe i murdered joffrey  no my lord you didnt gods no the world is a better place without him but i had nothing to do with it i would like to think if i were arranging a royal assassination id plan it in such a way that i wouldnt be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died trial in a fortnight less than you would have been have they announced the judges yet your father  of course mace tyrell who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote and prince oberyn of dorne  oberyn give it to my father he never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy im supposed to get a list of names from you my lord anyone who might testify on your behalf oh i can call my own witnesses if joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying how generous of them very well my wife sansa my lord shes gone gone  no ones seen her since the wedding you dont think she no one had more cause to kill joffrey than sansa but the girl is no assassin whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it and with my wifes disappearance it makes me seem that much more guilty podrick  yes my lord this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue theyll be following you now  who will i dont know they the ominous they the man pulling the strings or woman my father maybe joffrey was too much work for him sweet tommen will be so much easier to handle whenever something bad happens to me i assume its my sister that had a hand in it but say what you will of cersei she loves her children she is the only one im certain had nothing to do with this murder which makes it unique as kings landing murders go clawing at his own throat looking to his mother to make it stop any other witnesses my lord varys could vouch for me if he dared hes already been called as a witness for the queen of course fetch bronn i have a job for him ive already asked my lord they wont let him see you why not they say hes a known cutthroat and your close associate hes under investigation himself and my brother will they at least allow me to see jaime ill ask my lord where is she  no one leaves the capital it was horrible theres something else my lord a man i didnt know his face he came to ask if id testify against you said id be named ser podrick payne if i told the judges youd bought a poison called the strangler ser podrick payne has a nice ring to it what did you tell him  i didnt tell them anything my lord are you going to accept their offer my lord  testifying against me wasnt a suggestion if they cant tempt you with honey theyll choose something less sweet the world is overflowing with horrible things youve been good to me my lord  pod the trials in a fortnight theyll want an answer before that i already gave them an answer my lord i will not have you dying on my behalf do you hear me if i have to take that long walk to the executioners block i dont want to see your head already mounted my lord  pod i am giving you an order go and find my brother tell him i need him and get yourself out of kings landing before its too late but theyre all a tray of cakes next to death pod this is farewell farewell my lord pod there has never lived a more loyal squire mother says its time to eat whats she got boiling wait let me guess potatoes no one boils a potato better than your mom she got they brought me your grandfathers body when he died the wildlings guymon hide hide  run you know how to get to castle black  yes those your parents open your eyes im going to eat them do you hear me im going to eat your dead mama made me look at it and your dead papa go tell the crows at castle black we need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind aye aye three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the wall seems like that would be a good lesson  aye if we go after them well be giving them what they want they want to draw us out pick us off a few at a time we have just over  men and thats including stewards and builders what was it like and me we cant afford to lose a single man we must remember our first responsibility we are the watchers on the wall theres got to be a way to protect them youre a champion of the common people lord snow what do you say to brother pyps proposition mance rayder is coming if the wildlings breach the wall theyll roll over everything and everyone for  miles before they reach an army that can stop them they took me to the great hall there he was we need to shore up castle black and defend the wall that is our job rangers returning help him thought youd have blue eyes by now what took you so long we were held up  by what chains we were guests of the mutineers at crasters keep the man id married and suffered to father my children and the mutineers stayed  theyre not going anywhere theyve got crasters food and his wives poor girls never thought theyd miss their daddy karls running things now hes the one who put a knife through crasters mouth we need to ride north and kill them all we just went over this boy justice can wait  its not about justice i told the wildlings we had over  men at castle black alone karl and the others know the truth as well as we do a great doughy lump id sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings how long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off mance has all he needs to crush us he just doesnt know it yet as soon as he gets his hands on them he will then hell throw his full strength at us and even if every one of us kills  wildlings theres still not a thing we can do to stop them i dont think i can kill  wildlings are they attacking a single rider there he was a champion of meereen they want you to send your own champion against him what is he doing i believe he means to he says that were an army of men without man parts he claims you are no woman at all but a man who hides his cock in his own arsehole ignore him your grace these are meaningless words theyre not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them i have something to say to the people of meereen get in lying on a table first i will need this one to be quiet do i have a champion allow me this honour mother of dragons i will not disappoint you you

you lies about me or they may have told you nothing it does not matter i have nothing to say to them i speak only to you first i went to astapor those who were slaves in astapor now stand behind me free next i went to yunkai and was poisoned at our wedding feast those who were slaves in yunkai now stand behind me free now i have come to meereen i am not your enemy your enemy is beside you your enemy steals and murders your children your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands i did not bring you commands i must be cursed  nonsense i bring you a choice and i bring your enemies what they deserve forward fire your circumstances have improved markedly you may not have enjoyed watching him die but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him i can promise you that where are we going  somewhere safe but i would have been the queen our alliance with the lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us you did wonderful work on joffrey the next one should be easier your brother is dead do you know what that means im not trying to trick you it means ill become king yes you will become king up you go my lady what kind of king do you think youll be a good king  mmm i think so as well youve got the right temperament for it but what makes a good king hmm what is a good kings single most important quality this is hardly the place or the time holiness  hmm baelor the blessed was holy and pious ,5045
33,4,8.9,4,my name when did they take me he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him you gonna fight for him now to tell you the truth this isnt so bad four walls a pot to piss in i was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months is that supposed to make me feel better maybe a bit im sorry i didnt come sooner its complicated i was five years old so how is our sister how do you think her son died in her arms her son dont you know whats coming  hmm my trial for regicide i know the whole bloody country thinks im guilty that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than i can count you remember your home and that judge is my father as for cersei well shes probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed she did ask so should i turn around and close my eyes depends did you do it the kingslayer brothers you like it i like it i remember when they rowed us away from shore youre really asking if i killed your son are you really asking if id kill my brother how can i help you you could set me free you know i cant then theres really nothing else to say what do you want me to do kill the guards sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart im the lord commander of the kingsguard sorry id forgotten how white the beaches were id hate for you to do something inappropriate inappropriate youre accused of killing the king freeing you is treason except i didnt do it which is why were having a trial oh a trial if the killer threw himself before the iron throne confessed to his crimes and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt it wouldnt matter to cersei how tall the trees she wont rest until my heads on a spike not just yours shes offering a knighthood to whomever finds sansa stark sansa couldnt have done this she had more reason than anyone in the seven kingdoms do you think its a coincidence she disappeared the same night joffrey died no but sansas not a killer not yet anyway and i remember my village burning where are you taking me im getting married to your aunt lysa shes waiting for us at the eyrie youll be safe there did you kill joffrey did i kill joffrey ive been in the vale for weeks i know it was you and who helped me with this conspiracy there was ser dontos smoke rising into the sky you used him to get me out of kings landing but you would never trust him to kill the king why not because youre too smart to trust a drunk then perhaps it was your husband no how do you know i just do youre right he wasnt involved in joffreys death but you were do you remember your home do you remember that lovely necklace dontos gave you i dont suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast the poison i dont understand the lannisters gave you wealth power joffrey made you the lord of harrenhal a man with no motive is a man no one suspects always keep your foes confused if they dont know who you are or what you want they cant know what you plan to do next unsullied i dont believe you if they catch you theyll put your head on a spike just like my fathers youd risk that just to confuse them so many men they risk so little they spend their lives avoiding danger and then they die id risk everything to get what i want and what do you want everything is grey worm always unsullied my friendship with the lannisters was productive but joffrey a vicious boy with a crown on his head is not a reliable ally and who could trust a friend like that who could trust you i dont want friends like me my new friends are predictable very reasonable people as for what happened to joffrey that was something my new friends wanted very badly before unsullied nothing nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong i cant believe youre going leaving me alone here with these people the time has come my dear theres nothing more tedious than a trial except perhaps these gardens if i have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens ill fling myself from the cliffs have you been to see tommen yet thats not true no have they even agreed to the match no one tells me anything i wasnt originally meant to marry your grandfather luthor he was engaged to my sister your greataunt viola i was to be given to some targaryen or other marrying a targaryen was all the rage back then but the moment i saw my intended with his twitchy little ferrets face and ludicrous silver hair i knew he wouldnt do so the evening before luthor was to propose to my sister perhaps one day you will return to the summer isles i got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber how absentminded of me mmmhmm the following morning luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister cause the boy couldnt bloody walk and once he could the only thing he wanted was what id given him the night before i was good i was very good i dont want return you are even better but you need to act quickly cersei may be vicious but shes not stupid shell turn the boy against you as soon as she can and by the time youre married itll be too late luckily for you the queen regent is rather distracted at the moment mourning her dear departed boy accusing her brother of his murder which he didnt commit he could have done kill the masters but he didnt you dont know grandmother but i do know you dont think id let you marry that beast do you what i dont understand shh dont you worry yourself about all that you just do what needs to be done bring it through and again kill the masters very nice good a lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand first thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds lets see what you can do oily you just watch for now i can fight have you ever held a sword before i was the best archer in our hamlet i was how are the lessons coming i believe you well go hunting for rabbits one day right now watch and learn you two take it slow try and disarm each other you know how to fight you could have gone easier on him he wouldnt have learned anything that way lord snow what do you think youre doing missandel very well your grace grenn and i were helping them grenns a ranger youre a steward maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch but i didnt someone has to train them and that someone isnt you go find a chamber pot to empty go on do it you traitors bastard give me an excuse missandei is teacher good my queen mormonts not here to protect you now get back to work now i said now the bastards wellliked youre not you think i care if they like me were at war for now but you cant be acting commander forever there will be a choosing the old maester will insist on it i come from youll have to continue later you might reconsider his request to march on crasters let the mutineers take care of snow or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life a bastard eh took you for highborn my father was highborn my mother wasnt names locke jon snow you fight well its time what brought you up here a sense of duty i wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm i was a game warden in the stormlands fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids i was stupid enough to get caught chose the wall over losing my hand figured i wouldnt have to suck up to any highborn cunts here come on get on with it what are you waiting for summer you heard her guess i was wrong you sent for me your grace your grace how formal of you how many kingsguards are posted outside tommens door ser boros is on duty tonight tomorrow i believe so one you have one man guarding the future king i promise you tommens safe were protecting him she said she came to free us the way you protected joffrey why did catelyn stark set you free what ive been wondering for months ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital why did she set you free you know why shed hoped id send her daughters back to her she hoped or did you promise i swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive id return them to her youre a fool so you made a sacred vow to the enemy i wanted to get back to you should i have told her to fuck off you didnt mean it then you have no loyalty to catelyn stark catelyn starks dead so if i told you to leave the capital right now and find sansa if i told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head would you do it the masters are too strong i know you went to see tyrion that creature who murdered our son i had to see him i had to know for myself and he didnt do it cersei youve always pitied him our poor little brother abused by the world despised by his father and sister hed kill us all if he could she will protect us i want four men at tommens door day and night that will be all lord commander ser pounce how did you get past the kingsguard kingsguard i dont think youre supposed to be here mother doesnt allow me to have visitors at night im not a visitor your grace word has it im to be your bride did you know that people in arranged marriages she defeated the masters champion often never meet until their wedding day before we decide to spend our lives together we ought to get to know one another dont you think yes but if my mother found out it can be our secret hmm if were going to be man and wife well have a few secrets from her i hope she has a great army so

34,5,8.8,4,may the warrior grant him courage i now proclaim tommen of the house baratheon it appears my liberation of slavers bay isnt going quite as planned you could sail for westeros and leave it all behind a boy sits on the iron throne a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it theyve never been more vulnerable you counselled me against rashness once in qarth i didnt listen that all worked out well how can i rule seven kingdoms if i cant control slavers bay first of his name why should anyone trust me follow me youre a targaryen the mother of dragons i need to be more than that i will not let those i have freed slide back into chains i will not sail for westeros what then i will do what queens do i will rule king of the andals and the first men pull up your hood a memorable shade but how would they know you know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most ones about rich girls theyll never meet is this the only way into the eyrie the mountains are impassable if you want to get to the eyrie you need to go through the bloody gate it doesnt matter how large your army is if you attack this gate you do it on this road and lord of the seven kingdoms three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats the first lords of the vale didnt have much but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them and the fortress they built here has never been overcome not once in  years know your strengths use them wisely and one man can be worth who would pass the bloody gate lord petyr baelish and his niece alayne long may he reign stand to stand to welcome back lord baelish uncle petyr my lord oh i have brought you a gift lord baelish my lady  look what uncle petyr brought me a beautiful gift for a beautiful boy long may he reign its a pleasure to make your acquaintance lady arryn my name is  oh do take down that hood child dont you think i know who you are you think id let my intended leave the eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was i let him go so he could bring you here to me my flesh and blood its wonderful to meet you aunt lysa you mustnt call me that in front of anyone else i understand  no one can know youre here special day it would put us in a very precarious position i would never say a thing the lannisters want to destroy us theyve been trying for years now they know what it feels like mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brothers head they did and my fathers they killed my father too with poison i wanted to make the little lannister baby man fly but mother said i couldnt your grace make him fly through the moon door and on top of everything else they made you marry that filthy troll they made us both lord tyrion didnt want to i dont believe that did he force himself on you no we never  good robin this is your cousin sansa but youre not to call her sansa in front of anyone your grace but uncle petyr and myself do you understand sansa this is my son robin its a pleasure to meet you robin robin show sansa to her chamber take the back stairs go well speak soon what took you so long arranging for the ascension of king tommen i extricating sansa getting her here alive shes here weve spent more than enough time on her for one evening lets get married tonight your grace ought we not inform the lords of the vale about the ceremony theres only one lord of the vale the others can all hang lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died trying to get their claws in me  i do think that we could wait until im done waiting petyr we had our wedding night many years ago or dont you remember like it was yesterday and protect him in these perilous times your grace what wife would do for you the things ive done what wife would trust you the way ive trusted you when you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into jons wine my husbands wine when you told me to write a letter to cat telling her it was the the deed is done faded into nothing only speaking of it can make it real there he is tonight it is then let me bathe and dress for the occasion once im presentable ill call on the septon immediately im warning you im going to scream when my husband makes love to me so loud theyll hear me clear across the narrow sea when will the wedding take place in your mind cersel as soon as decency permits after weve allowed tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and margaery to mourn her husband long may he reign a fortnight  that seems reasonable no jugglers no jousting dwarves no course meals and your wedding to loras shortly after tommens shortly  a fortnight i know you dont like them i didnt like your husband used to pat me on the back a lot i didnt trust him long may he reign we had that in common you dont need to make formal alliances with people you trust then whom can we trust ourselves alone the tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side robert wasnt particularly rich robert had me funding him wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth he sits the throne like he was born to it i suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one do you know how much gold was mined in the westerlands this past year havent a clue your best guess pounds tons ounces doesnt matter the answer is the same cant be our last working mine ran dry three years ago then how do we pay for anything the crown owes the iron bank of braavos a tremendous amount of money yes he wasnt though was he how much a tremendous amount there must be someone at the iron bank you can speak to come to some arrangement the iron bank is the iron bank there is no someone someone does work there it is comprised of people and a temple is comprised of stones one stone crumbles and another takes its place and the temple holds its form for  years or more thats what the iron bank is a temple we all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it no he wasnt you cant run from them you cant cheat them you cant sway them with excuses if you owe them money and you dont want to crumble yourself you pay it back vesting the tyrells in the crown will help a great deal its for the good of the family i understand that im not sure my brothers do i know youre building a strong case against tyrion and as a mother that is your right but as a judge i cannot discuss the trial with you you still mourn for joffrey i respect that we dont need to discuss it the lannister legacy is the only thing that matters youve started wars to protect this family turned your back on jaime for refusing to contribute to its future what does tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire joffrey cersei walder frey he was my husband my king meryn trant tywin lannister the red woman beric dondarrion thoros of myr ilyn payne the mountain would you shut up i cant sleep until i say the names the names of every fucking person in westeros he would have been your nightmare only the ones im going to

your grace you crucified him i pray youll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly your father crucified innocent children my father spoke out against crucifying those children he decried it as a criminal act but was overruled is it justice to answer one crime with another i am sorry you no longer have a father but my treatment of the masters was no crime in blood and gold youd be wise to remember that whats done is done you are the queen and i am a servant of meereen a servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated and what traditions do you speak of  of funeral rite proper burial in the temple of the graces my father and  noble meereenese are still nailed to those posts carrion for vultures rotting in the sun your grace i ask that you order these men taken

residence in meereen she has conquered the city and rules as its queen conquered with what she commands an army of unsullied my queen some  strong and madman and blood right she has a company of sellswords the second sons she has two knights advising her jorah mormont and barristan selmy and she has three dragons baby dragons larger every year your grace mormont is spying on her for us no longer he appears to be fully devoted to her as for ser barristan it would seem he took his dismissal from the kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated easterners have a different sense of time here our books are filled with numbers hes an old man he wasnt fit to protect my son joffrey didnt die on his watch dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid dont tell me youre worried about a child halfway across the world a child with two seasoned warriors counselling her and a powerful army at her back your grace lord varys is right i have been to essos and seen the unsullied firsthand they are very impressive on the battlefield we prefer the stories they tell less so in the bedroom dragons havent won a war in  years armies win them all the time she must be dealt with how my lord by force eventually if it comes to that can your little birds find their way into meereen most certainly my lord hand mmm lord tyrell be a good man fetch my quill and paper prince oberyn more plain lord varys only varys im not actually a nobleman no one is under obligation to call me lord and yet everyone does you seem quite knowledgeable about the unsullied did you spend much time in essos five years may i ask why tis a big and beautiful world most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born less open to interpretation and never get to see any of it i dont want to be most of us most of us arent princes you are from essos where lys i have an ear for accents ive lost my accent entirely i have an ear for that as well hmm how did you get here how many fighting men remain loyal to you its a long story one you dont like telling people people i trust my paramour ellaria she would find you very interesting you should come to the brothel and meet her we brought our own wine not the swill they serve here we have some lovely boys on retainer but you did like boys before really girls hmm i hope you wont be offended when i say i never would have guessed not at all but i was never interested in girls either what then  nothing everybody is interested in something not me when i see what desire does to people what its done to this country i am very glad to have no part in it besides the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things and how many ships do you have such as let me guess ive been pardoned really fathers orders well we mustnt disappoint father kingslayer i tommen of the house baratheon first of my name king of the andals and the first men and lord of the seven kingdoms uh  the ones still afloat ser davos do hereby recuse myself from this trial tywin of the house lannister hand of the king protector of the realm will sit as judge in my stead and with him prince oberyn of the house martell and lord mace of the house tyrell and if found guilty may the gods punish the accused tyrion of the house lannister you stand accused by the queen regent of regicide did you kill king joffrey not at the bottom of blackwater bay no did your wife the lady sansa not that i know of how would you say he died then choked on his pigeon pie so you would blame the bakers or the pigeons just leave me out of it the crown may call its first witness once wed got king joffrey safely away from the mob the imp rounded on him thirtytwo  and how much wheat and barley he slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool it wasnt the first time the imp threatened joffrey right here in this throne room he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit compared his grace to the mad king and suggested hed meet the same fate and when i spoke in the kings defence he threatened to have me killed oh why dont you tell them what joffrey was doing silence  pointing a loaded crossbow at sansa stark once i was waiting for salladhor saan here in braavos and beef and pork do you produce on dragonstone while you tore at her clothes and beat her silence you will not speak unless called upon youre dismissed ser meryn basilisk venom widows blood wolfsbane essence of nightshade sweetsleep tears of lys to feed your  men on your  ships demons dance blindeye i think you have made your point grand maester you have a lot of poison in your store had prince oberyn my stores were plundered by whom by the accused tyrion lannister after he had me wrongfully imprisoned grand maester you examined king joffreys corpse none was it without question poison that killed him without question this was found on the body of dontos hollard the kings fool he was last seen spiriting sansa stark the wife of the accused away from the feast she wore this necklace the day of the wedding residue of the most rare and terrible poison was found inside was this one of the poisons stolen from your store it was the strangler you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending a poison few in the seven kingdoms possess and used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth cersel i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid your own brother said this to you shortly before the battle of blackwater bay i confronted him about his plans to put joffrey on the front lines from our perspective as it turned out when the attack came joff insisted on remaining at the battlements he believed his presence would inspire the troops tyrion said and you will know the debt is paid what debt i discovered hed been keeping whores in the tower of the hand i asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behaviour belongs he wasnt pleased thank you your grace for the courage of your testimony im afraid we must respectfully decline your request do you remember the precise nature of this threat im afraid i do my lord he said perhaps you should speak more softly to me then monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council yes after we received word of robb starks death he didnt seem gladdened by the news perhaps his marriage to sansa stark but we thank you for paying us the honour of your visit had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause youre excused lord varys father may i ask the witness one question one you once said that without me this city would have faced certain defeat you said the histories would never mention me but you would not forget have you forgotten lord varys sadly my lord my lord  im not a lord ser davos seaworth i never forget a thing we will adjourn for now toll the bells in an hours time clear the court youd condemn your own son to death ive condemned no one the trial is not over this isnt a trial its a farce cersei has manipulated everything and you know it i know nothing of the sort youve always hated tyrion  he killed his king you would not be either here as did i do you know the last order the mad king gave me to bring him your head i saved your life so you could murder my brother it wont be murder itll be justice  justice im performing my sworn duty as hand of the king if tyrion is found guilty he will be punished accordingly hell be executed  no hell be punished accordingly once you said family is what lives on all that lives on in braavos you told me about a dynasty that would last  years what happens to your dynasty when tyrion dies im a kingsguard forbidden by oath to carry on the family line im well aware what happens to your name who carries the lion banner into future battles your nephews lancel lannister others whose names i dont even remember what happens to my dynasty if i spare the life of my grandsons killer together we were going to run three shiploads of the finest thieves are not rewarded with titles it survives through me ill leave the kingsguard ill take my place as your son and heir if you let tyrion live done when the testimonys concluded and a guilty verdict rendered tyrion will be given the chance to speak hell plead for mercy ill allow him to join the nights watch in three days time hell depart for castle black and live out his days at the wall i didnt do the thieving youll remove your white cloak immediately you will leave kings landing to assume your rightful place at casterly rock you will marry a suitable woman and father children named lannister and youll never turn your back on your family again you have my word and you have mine not going well is it youre going to be found guilty that would be the pirates oh you think so  and when you are you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the wall fathers agreed to it hell spare your life and allow you to join the nights watch ned stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out father is not joffrey hell keep his word how do you know do you trust me keep your mouth shut no more outbursts this will all be over soon i just moved what they stole from one place to another the crown may call its next witness state your name shae do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest i swear it do you know this man yes tyrion lannister how do you know him i was handmaiden to his wife lady sansa this man stands accused of murdering king joffrey this is the payment that was demanded by king stannis for my crimes what do you know of this i know that hes guilty he and sansa planned it together silence continue she wanted revenge for her father her mother her brother she blamed their deaths on the king tyrion was happy to help he hated joffrey he hated the queen he hated you my lord i consider it an honest accounting he stole poison from the grand maesters chamber to put in joffreys wine how could you possibly know all this why would he reveal such plans to his wifes maid i wasnt just her maid i was his whore i beg your pardon you said you were his his whore how did you come to be in his service hes an honest man and hes your best chance he stole me i was with another man a knight in your lordships army but when tyrion arrived at the camp he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent he broke the knights arm and brought me to lord tyrion you belong to me now he said i want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world silence and did you did i what fuck him like it was his last night in this world to get back the money youve sunk into westeros i did everything he wanted whatever he told me to do to him whatever he felt like doing to me i kissed him where he wanted i licked him where he wanted i let him put himself where he wanted i was his property i would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored he ordered me to call him my lion so i did i took his face in my hands and said i am yours and you are mine which is a lot wars are expensive shae please dont i am a whore remember that was before he married sansa after that all he wanted was her but she wouldnt let him into her bed so he promised to kill king joffrey for her father i wish to confess the war is over  as long as stannis lives the war is not over i wish to confess you wish to confess i saved you i saved this city and all your worthless lives i should have let stannis kill you all tyrion do you wish to confess yes father im guilty welcome to the iron bank whos the real power in kings landing is that what you want to hear you admit you poisoned the king no of that im innocent im guilty of a far more monstrous crime i am guilty of being a dwarf you are not on trial for being a dwarf oh yes i am ive been on trial for that my entire life have you nothing to say in your defence  nothing but this i did not do it ser davos  humour me i did not kill joffrey but i wish that i had watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than  lying whores i wish i was the monster you think i am i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you i would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it ser meryn escort the prisoner back to his cell i will not give my life for joffreys murder tywin lannister  how old is tywin lannister and i know ill get no justice here so i will let the gods decide my fate i demand a trial by combat sixtyseven and when he dies whos in command a halfgrown boy the product of incest cersei lannister a queen whose people despise her jaime lannister a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect please sit when tywins gone who do you back that is a problem for another time i think its a problem for now theres only one reliable leader left in westeros stannis hes got the birthright hes in his prime hes a tried and tested battle commander and he doesnt just talk about paying people back he does it the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way what can we do for you lord stannis the captain shouts to his first mate bring me my red shirt the first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on and when the pirates try to board the brave captain leads his men to victory a few days later the lookout screams two pirate ships the crew is shivering like scared mice but the courageous captain hollers bring me my red shirt this is stannis of the house baratheon after the battle the first mate asks captain why do you call for your red shirt before battle the captain replies so that if i am stabbed you will not see me bleed the next morning the lookout screams ten pirate ships we are surrounded the crew goes silent they all look to their brave captain waiting for his usual command calm as ever the captain bellows ,4086

great song i hope to hear them sing it one day how did you get in here your door is well guarded but your window is not fuck your own sister youll always be the golden son i swam to an island a mile offshore for these dont do that again never met a woman who didnt like wildflowers these are my private quarters if i want you here i will summon you forgive me my queen i live to serve you tell me why youre here i came to ask a favour i only have two talents in this world war and women careful you are staying here in meereen to rule that is a wise decision i respect it but here in meereen i cannot pursue my talents ive ordered the second sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killings youve ordered us to be night watchmen and as for women there are thousands in meereen you can pursue there is only one and she does not want me you swore me your sword my sword is yours till the day i die im the last friend youve got so if i command you to stay in meereen and patrol the streets ill stay in meereen and patrol the streets send me to kill your enemies any enemy anywhere let me do what i do best very well do what you do best take off your clothes oh come in my queen please at least i got to tell them what they really are i didnt mean to disturb you my lady you could never i just wanted to speak with you before we left could you bring me that vial over there the blue one no not that one you dont even want to touch that one next to it thats the one when i looked into the flames this morning the lord spoke to me yes brilliant speech he said tonight you will have your last good bath in a long while make it count a joke not a very good one im afraid it was i humour isnt my strength thats because most jokes are lies and youre devoted to the truth if theyre lies my lady arent they best avoided not always im sorry what am i grateful for theyll be talking about it for days to come most of these powders and potions are lies deceptions to make men think they witnessed our lords power once they step into his light they will see the lie for what it was a trick that led them to the truth a pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky and this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear and a drop of this in any mans wine will drive him wild with lust i thought you were a realist did you use it with stannis no dont be upset men never crave what they already have its only flesh it needs what it needs no act done in service of the lord can ever be called a sin i thank god every day for bringing you to us and stannis to you he wants to bring shireen with us didnt realise youd die for pride i think that would be illadvised my daughter has heretical tendencies as youre well aware i dont know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me but whichever the case she should stay home i understand how you feel but that is impossible why you dont need powders and potions my queen you dont need lies you are strong enough to look into the lords light and see his truth for yourself dont give up on me just yet however harsh it is however hard for us to understand you dont need my help but i will need yours soon when we set sail your daughter must be with us the lord needs her jorah the andal are you here to see our queen shes in a good mood khaleesi youre here early  later than some i survived one trial by combat even though you werent there to save me you dont approve  its not a question of approval its a question of trust you neither approve nor trust why would i the mans a sellsword didnt you fight for the golden company before pledging your sword to my brother i did i trust you daario naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands how could you ever have faith in a man like that i cant save you this time either i could never have faith in a man like daario thats why ive sent him and the second sons to retake yunkai you have  i have without you there to rule khaleesi i fear the masters will simply bide their time wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control that is why ive ordered daario to execute every master in yunkai the masters tear babies from their mothers arms they mutilate little boys by the thousands they train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men my training has proved that i cant beat a stable boy with my left hand they treat men like beasts as you said yourself herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts the slaves you freed brutality is all theyve ever known if you want them to know something else youll have to show it to them and repay the slavers with what kindness a fine a stern warning its tempting to see your enemies as evil all of them but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought let the priests argue over good and evil wheres your sense of adventure slavery is real i can end it i will end it and those behind it i sold men into slavery khaleesi and now you are helping me show them to freedom i wouldnt be here to help you if ned stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of yunkai the man who came to me the other day about burying his father hizdahr zo loraq he will accompany the second sons and serve as my ambassador to yunkai even if you lose imagine the look on fathers face when you fall he will tell the masters what has happened in meereen he will explain the choice they have before them they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one well go and catch daario before he leaves tell him i changed my mind yes khaleesi no tell him you changed my mind rat cunts fucking whore our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword youre doing it wrong you need to burn away that horrible bit there otherwise its gonna get infected and fester i know you dont like fire but if you dont do it right no fire itll only take a second it wont hurt that much  no fire shut up about it about everything thanks to you im a walking bag of silver anywhere the lannisters hold sway the opportunity to live and die at the wall as punishment for a crime i did not commit it is tempting which is everywhere between where we are now and where were going im as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten no reward is worth this much trouble wish id never laid eyes on you you say your brother gave you that sword my brother gave me this it was just like you said a while back pressed me to the fire like i was a nice juicy mutton chop why well thought i stole one of his toys i didnt steal it i was just playing with it the pain was bad the smell was worse but the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it my father who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire you think youre on your own let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least bit of comfort never hurt anyone bronn fought for me once hell do it again weve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks i think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you couldnt agree more my lady just dont start expecting silk underclothes not working for your former lord any longer  yes my lady dont get drunk no my lady can i get you anything else no this will do nicely thank you if he wins kidney pie is wonderful thanks i do my best a good kidney pie is all about the ingredients flour lard water eggs milk easy enough but the meat peacetime or not getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves kidneys is not easy i mean some people settle for plain old beef kidneys got no right to cook anything them oh and the gravy i expect ill be in his debt for the rest of my life dont get me started on the gravy very difficult to get right see a lot of people give up on the gravy you cannot give up no gravy no pie simple as that thats nice armour are you a knight no oh its just people with armour are usually knights generally speaking from kings landing though arent you if he wins from there myself originally flea bottom born and bred what brings you to these parts were looking for someone someone in particular maybe they came in here a lot of people come in here just the other day we had a girl tall red hair very pretty her name is sansa stark but she may be using a different name starks what like them lot from winterhell no aint seen anyone like that will you find him for me i heard they was all traitors dont need no traitors in here i pledged my life to their mother catelyn stark i swore to her id bring her daughters home sure i cant get you a bit more kidney pie what  its nothing my lady you wouldnt be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing dont want to offend my lady truly i dont youre not interesting enough to be offensive the lannisters want lady sansa who does cersei plan on naming as a champion the lannisters have money people kill for money i dont think we should be telling people were searching for lady sansa my lady my lord could i have a word what about not kidney pie  you seem like a proper lady someone who could be trusted i never met no sansa stark but i know her sister arya no ones seen arya stark since her father was beheaded i hope its ser meryn trant shes presumed dead she werent when i last spoke to her when was that  heading up north with the nights watch she was all dressed up as a boy like your ladyship only without the armour going by the name arry so what happened to her  well the quick version the lannisters took us prisoner we escaped id enjoy watching bronn disembowel that pompous child beater the brotherhood took us prisoner they sold me to the innkeep they were gonna sell arya to her mother at riverrun along with another prisoner big ugly fellow foul mouth and a face like a halfburnt ham not friendly  the hound thats the one if you find her could you give her this she liked the last one i gave her but well this one turned out better um you were saying her mothers dead grandfathers dead you threw your life away no walder frey is the new lord of riverrun the brotherhood isnt going to riverrun theyll take her to the eyrie my lady why the eyrie her aunt lysa arryn catelyn starks sister shes aryas last living relative with money she hates the lannisters lord tyrion made sure i knew which house married which and who hated who not ser meryn sansa could be there too could be you sure about this no i imagined youd be back at the brothel at this hour i did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day mmm do tell ive got every kind of filth down here except the kind i like your sister oh go on move it cersei approached me we spoke a great deal about her daughter how worried your sister is about her she was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you i think she may have even believed it herself making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts it was difficult for her to hide her true intentions it is rare to meet a lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead lannisters she desperately wants to see you killed and you she didnt need to bother you it looks as though ive taken care of that myself the joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck shes wanted this for a long time yes i know we met you and i many years ago i think i would have remembered that unlikely you had just been born our father brought me and my sister elia with him on a visit to casterly rock come on my first time away from dorne i didnt like anything about the rock not the food not the weather not your accents nothing but the biggest disappointment you you and my family have more in common than you might admit the whole way from dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to tywin lannister a head twice the size of his body mercy a tail between his legs claws one red eye the privates of both a girl and a boy that would have made things so much easier when we met your sister she promised she would show you to us every day we would ask every day she would say soon then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak your head was a bit large your arms and legs were a bit small please but no claw no red eye no tail between your legs just a tiny pink cock we didnt try to hide our disappointment thats not a monster i told cersei thats just a baby and she said he killed my mother and she pinched your little cock so hard i thought she might pull it off until your brother made her stop it doesnt matter she told us everyone says he will die soon please mercy i hope they are right he should not have lived this long well sooner or later cersei always gets what she wants and what about what i want justice for my sister and her children if you want justice youve come to the wrong place i disagree cersel ser gregor ive come to the perfect place i want to bring those who have wronged me to justice and all those who have wronged me are right here i will begin with ser gregor clegane who killed my sisters children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her too i will be your champion hello robin what are you doing welcome to the capital im building my home winterfell at least i think i am i havent been back there in a very long time why did you leave its a long story i stay here in the eyrie mother says its dangerous on the roads and i have to keep myself safe because im the lord of the vale and a very important person yes you certainly are when will you go back its not a joke you understand that dont you thank you for riding here so quickly probably never my family doesnt live there any more and someone burned it down oh does winterfell have a moon door no im afraid not its not high up in the mountains its down on the ground that sounds dangerous how do you make people fly  we dont what do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you dont like you seem to be in good form i never did anything with them at all girls didnt take part in that where i came from well im lord of the vale when i grow up ill be able to fly anybody who bothers me or you when we get married you can tell me if you dont like somebody and then we can bring them back here and whoosh right through the moon door i like the sound of that lets put a moon door in your winterfell who am i fighting all right it can go in here in this big tower  be careful youve ruined it now im going to have to rebuild the whole thing i didnt ruin it  you did it was already ruined because it didnt have a moon door i was fixing it  knocking things down isnt fixing them its

consider it a step in the right direction if he tells aunt lysa let me worry about aunt lysa i was trying to remember what everything looked like ill never see it again a lot can happen between now and never if you want to build a better home could be food first you must demolish the old one why did you really kill joffrey tell me why i loved your mother more than you could ever know given the opportunity what do we do to those whove hurt the ones we love in a better world one where love could overcome strength and duty you might have been my child but we dont live in that world could be soldiers youre more beautiful than she ever was lord baelish call me petyr you wanted to see me aunt lysa come here sansa do you know how far the fall is no neither do i precisely hundreds of feet its fascinating you shouldnt be sitting out here like this what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height the impact breaks them right apart like eggs dropped on the floor sometimes

what i know time to go i couldnt listen to her standing there telling her lies take matters into me own hands the thought has occurred to me so why go on habit nothing could be worse than this maybe nothing is worse than this nothing isnt better or worse than anything nothing is just nothing who are you my name is arya i couldnt do it arya stark you her father her captor bringing her to her aunt

waymar to the wall sansa stark what you tell lies right to my face you little worm lord baelish has told many lies all to protect me since my father was executed i have been a hostage in kings landing a plaything for joffrey to torture or queen cersei to torment they beat me they humiliated me they married me to the imp i had no friends in kings landing except one its just an owl you dumb bitch he saved me smuggled me away when he had the chance he knew id be safe here in the eyrie with my own blood my aunt lysa but the lannisters have friends everywhere even the vale he made me swear not to tell anyone my true name your secret is safe with us my lady your father grew up right here in these halls we hunted together many times he was a fine man no its not tell us what happened to your aunt sansa you knew her well my lords my lady she was a troubled woman she always loved lord baelish she told me herself from the moment he arrived at the gates of riverrun a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack she confessed to me she never loved lord arryn she did as her father commanded as so many of us have when the gods finally allowed her to be with lord baelish she was so happy for a time shh my aunt was a jealous lady she was terrified that lord baelish didnt love her any more that he would abandon her for a younger woman and then one day she saw him kiss me lady sansa it was a peck on the cheek lord royce nothing more lord baelish is my uncle now by marriage hes always been so kind to me i was so happy to be here to be free i should never have left her there all because of him but my aunt turned on me she cursed me called me a whore promised to throw me through the moon door when lord baelish tried to calm her she struck him she said she didnt want to live any more she stood on the edge of that moon door he tried to reason with her promised her she was the only one he had ever loved but she stepped through those doors and she was the rains of castamere you couldnt have known  of course i couldve its not your fault sweet girl its not your fault you could see it in the way she raised that boy feeding him from her own teats when he was  years old lord royce this is hardly the time apologies my lady and to you as well baelish we treated you a bit harshly you want justice lord royce i can hardly complain about that i want the same not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there theyve been raiding the villages close by for lysa no but for her son only  years ago the knights of the vale rode behind jon arryn ned stark robert baratheon they fought together to overcome the mad king and since then arryn and royce corbray waynwood all the great houses of the vale watched from the corner a timid boy at a tavern brawl are you questioning our courage i want to know which side youre on do you support the lannisters the house that executed your friend ned stark and we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers of course we dont support the damn lannisters no catelyn stark begged her sister for support and lysa refused by staying out of the fray youve allowed tywin lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point who stands against him now who would you have us back lord baelish robb stark is dead id have you back robin arryn lord of the vale robin arryn is a sickly little boy our brothers had orders to stay at castle black and sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men more often they die young i adored lysa with all my heart but she loved her son so much she became overprotective he needs to learn how to swing a sword how to ride a horse aye its time  yes time for him to tour the vale to visit all the castles in his domain time for robin to leave the nest ser barristan yes so its all right then who sent you ser barristan  ser jorah have i forgotten a council meeting no whats this a royal pardon signed by robert baratheon you spied on her who gave you this does it matter have

never be alone with her again why did the usurper pardon you if we could speak alone no speak to me here explain it to me who do you think sent this to meereen who profits this is the work of tywin lannister he wants to divide us i didnt say it was all right im saying they shouldnt have been there if were fighting each other were not fighting him the pardon was signed the year we met why were you pardoned unless youre saying this document was forged it is not forged why then i sent letters to varys the spymaster of kings landing what was the content of these letters information  what

break of day ill have your head thrown into slavers bay go now moat cailin is yours father walk with me has there been any word from locke no unimportant a cripple a young boy none of the northern lords have seen them its what they want dead most likely most of the ironborn have fled the north now more will follow thanks to you tell me what you see moors fields hills tell me what you see nothing not nothing the north ride  miles that way youre still in the north miles that way and little sam miles that way the north is larger than the other six kingdoms combined and i am the warden of the north the north is mine now tell me what is your name ramsay snow no not ramsay snow open it from this day until your last day you are ramsay bolton as if i cut their throats myself son of roose bolton warden of the north you honour me i swear i will uphold your name and your tradition i will be worthy of you father i promise come reek ill be needing a bath yes first time i saw you you were just a child a girl from the north come to the capital for the first time youre not a child any longer maybe she managed to hide herself why did you help me they would have thrown you through the moon door if they found you guilty thats not an answer if theyd have executed you what would they have done with me i dont know neither do i better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you dont and you think you know me i know what you want  do you i thought itd make me happy i thought all of you was dead but it doesnt not really nothing makes you happy lots of things make me happy  like what killing polliver killing rorge so youre sad because you didnt get to kill joffrey yourself is that it at least i could have been there to watch i wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over aye nothing in the world beats that look you protected him for most of his life you think you could have saved him you went up north with mormont and no one came back i wasnt the damn winetaster little shit deserved to die but poison poisons a womans weapon men kill with steel thats your stupid pride talking its why youll never be a great killer id have killed joffrey with a chicken bone if i had to id pay good money to see that you should have let me burn it its a fleabite that fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to not for ages well we wont have to walk too much further you really think my aunt will pay for me aye ive never even met her doesnt matter youre her blood family honour all that horseshit its all you lords and ladies ever talk about im not a lady who would pass the bloody gate the bloody hound sandor clegane but then you did and his travelling companion arya stark niece of your lady lysa arryn then i offer my condolences lady arryn died three days ago ive never left home before uncle petyr im afraid to leave you shouldnt be the lord of the vale belongs in the eyrie mother said its not safe outside she survived craster and he was the worst shit ive ever met it wasnt safe for her inside people die at their dinner tables they die in their beds they die squatting over their chamber pots everybody dies sooner or later dont worry about your death worry about your life take charge of your life for as long as it lasts that is what it means to be lord of the vale shall we go same wrong guess every fucking time she survived the long march to the wall wine always helps i thank you for it trial by combat deciding a mans guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces tells you something about the gods how much longer soon do you think oberyn has a chance she survived a white walker for fucks sake the red viper of dorne you dont get a name like that unless youre deadly right ive never seen him fight oh hes going to die im going to die oberyn believes in himself  thats putting it mildly whats the punishment for regicide drawing and quartering hanging breaking at the wheel  beheading seems rather ordinary and he was my nephew as well so what is that she might have got out fratricide is brothers and filicide is sons nepoticide thats the one matricide patricide infanticide suicide theres no kind of killing that doesnt have its own word cousins  youre right there is no word for cousinkilling well done do you remember cousin orson orson lannister of course wetnurse dropped him on his head and left him simple she might have simple used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock nothing made him happier  nothing made you happier youd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted on the contrary laughing at another persons misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else the joke wore thin though  for you you drifted away i had other interests if they hit moles town yes other interests but i stayed with orson  why i was curious why was he smashing all those beetles what did he get out of it first thing i did was ask him orson why are you smashing all those beetles he gave me an answer smash the beetles smash em i wasnt deterred i was the smartest person i knew then were next certainly i had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron so i went to maester volariks library volarik tried to touch me once turns out far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons doesnt seem right in any case i found nothing that illuminated the nature of orsons affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter so i went back to the source mance and his army must be close i may not have been able to speak with orson but i could observe him watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behaviour and as i watched i became more and more sure of it there was something happening there his face was like the page of a book written in a language i didnt understand but he wasnt mindless he had his reasons of them and i became possessed with knowing what they were i began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him i would eat my lunch in the garden chewing my mutton to the music of and when i wasnt watching him i was thinking about him father droned on about the family legacy and i thought about orsons beetles i read the histories of targaryen conquests did i hear dragon wings no i heard and theres what  of us left and i still couldnt figure out why he was doing it and i had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason every day around the world men women and children are murdered by the score who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles i know but still it filled me with dread piles and piles of them years and years of them how many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt you counting black jack kegs and mully in my dreams i found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see i woke up crying weeping for their shattered little bodies i tried to stop orson once he was twice your size he just pushed me aside with a cuhn and kept on smashing every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him so what do you think listen you cunt why did he do it what was it all about i dont know good luck today looks like very light armour i like to move around you could at least wear a helmet you shouldnt drink before a fight you learned this during your years in the fighting pits i always drink before a fight how do  men stop it could get you killed it could get me killed today is not the day i die youre going to fight that im going to kill that he is the biggest man ive ever seen size does not matter when you are flat on your back thank the gods in the sight of gods and men we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this man tyrion lannister whoever dies last may the mother grant them mercy may the father give them such justice as they deserve and may the warrior guide the hand of our champion dont leave me alone in this world never have they told you who i am some dead man i am the brother of elia martell and do you know why i have come all the way to this stinking shitpile of a city for you be a good lad and burn the rest of us im going to hear you confess before you die you raped my sister you murdered her you killed her children say it now and we can make this quick say it you raped her you murdered her you killed her children you raped her you murdered her you killed her children you raped her you murdered her once im done with this world you killed her children wait are you dying no you cant die yet you havent confessed say it say her name elia martell you raped her you killed her children elia martell who gave you the order who gave you the order say her name i dont want to come back you raped her you murdered her you killed her children say her name say it elia martell i killed her children then i raped her then i smashed her head in like this the gods have made their will known tyrion lannister you think he was spying on you in the name of king tommen of the house baratheon first of his name you are hereby sentenced to death missandel no not spying the dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body they make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see oh yes your grace but you are not dothraki no well i dont see why it matters grey worm isnt interested none of the unsullied care whats under our clothes he was interested what i believe he was interested when the slavers castrate the boys do they take all of it the bear and the maiden fair all of it the pillar and the stones i dont know your grace havent you ever wondered yes your grace missandei i have come to apologise you dont need to apologise i hope i didnt frighten you no yes  theres a man with an ear the lessons you give i in common tongue these are precious to i to me  to me i dont remember teaching you the word precious jorah the andal he teaches i he teaches me this word do you remember the name you were given at birth i remember nothing only unsullied when they cut you ,4201

arrows finding its way into a crows heart we could be waiting here a while good the longer we wait the more arrows ill have they came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs to be with someone then they started hunting us down but this time were the ones doing the hunting youve got a lot to say about killing even more words than arrows back in those villages i killed just as many of them as you did more i reckon yes but none of those were your crow lover i probably killed him already so youve said and if not to love someone and have them love you back the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around me neck more words know what i think you do when you see him serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge what youve been thinking about that ginger minge wondering what it tastes like maybe i have jon snow is mine anyone else tries to kill him ill have an arrow for them were all gonna die a lot sooner than id planned and not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me and what is it that couldnt wait until morning tarly maester aemon how did you know  that it was you who else but samwell tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night let me help you  oh no need i know my way around this library better than any other place in castle black thousands of books and no eyes to read them old age is a wonderful source of ironies youre the closest ill ever get to knowing if nothing else but you didnt answer my question what are you reading maester faull ah the wildlings i can assure you that the closest maester faull ever got to a wildling was this very library but what he says about what they do its all true ,2757
39,10,9.7,4,youre wearing a black cloak again i was loyal youre speaking to the one true king boy you will address him as your grace i know hes the king my father died for him my name is jon snow your grace im ned starks son your father was an honourable man he was your grace what do you think hed have done with him i was this mans prisoner once he could have tortured me he could have killed me to him and to my nights watch vows but he spared my life i think my father would have taken him prisoner listened to what he had to say very well then take him your grace if my father had seen the things that ive seen hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall all of them i would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate  bloody martells all your vows the cause appears to be manticore venom it is the deaths head manticore ive read a great deal about it its a horrible poison usually mantari in origin oh theres nothing to be done yes there is may i ask what you think youre doing saving him your grace i wish it were otherwise but ser gregor is beyond saving she wasnt enough to turn you eh well well beyond this man is not even a maester let alone grand maester thats for the best no maester knows how to save him that is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel your grace his curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural rightly so in my opinion youre dismissed grand maester but your grace this is my laboratory not any more  but were you enough to turn her you can save him  difficult to say your grace but if my past work is any guide we stand a chance do everything you can come to me for anything you need thank you your grace you should know the process may change him somewhat will it weaken him she put three arrows in me when i escaped oh no very well then not another word weve been over this the matters closed im opening it again you were betrothed to loras tyrell youre still betrothed to loras tyrell and you will marry loras tyrell as soon as tommen marries margaery i will not jaime cannot marry or inherit lands did you see her again at castle black tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow

any circumstances lf you recall  im not interested in hearing yes another one of your smug stories about the time you won this isnt going to be one of those times do you think youll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will when you marched into the throne room to tell me wed won the battle of blackwater do you remember i was sitting on the iron throne with tommen

kingdoms and youre not dressed for this weather he made me kill him so youd trust me it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king we do not kneel ill have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall have nowhere to put them have nothing to feed them im not here to slaughter beat dogs their fate depends on their king all the same we do not kneel take these men away whats a man of the nights watch doing in a wildling camp i was sent to discuss terms with the kingbeyondthewall ,3673
40,1,8.6,5,we shouldnt be out here alone  why not listen to your friend a group of people who saw robert baratheon for the disaster he was we tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting a targaryen restoration and thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here things have gotten worse not better westeros needs to be saved from itself mmm much better they said that you were terrifying my lord i dont think i am anymore a lord are you a lord if you kill your father i dont imagine they revoke your nobility for killing a whore it must happen all the time you already drank yourself across the narrow sea in a box why stop now because we are talking about the future of our country with cats teeth and three eyes the future is shit just like the past shh shh the sons of the harpy youre not terrifying yes your grace they left it on the body theyve never killed before it was only a matter of time your grace conquerors always meet with resistance i didnt conquer them their own people did he did not risk his life fighting for his freedom so cowards in masks could take it away and i did not take up residence in this pyramid youre boring so i could watch the city below decline into chaos what was the name of the man you lost white rat your grace i want him buried with honor publically in the temple of the graces the sons of the harpy will hear that message make them very angry angry snakes lash out makes chopping off their heads that much easier find the men who did this and bring them to me you dont know what i am your grace torgo nudho missandei hin naath i wanted to speak with you why do you come white rat the unsullied who i have heard they found his body in a brothel i have heard that more than one unsullied has been known to visit meereens brothels may i ask you why i know youre a witch and you can see the future why would an unsullied go to a brothel i do not know i must go get your shield up  its too heavy if it wasnt heavy it wouldnt stop a sword now get it up come try it again drive at me keep your shield up or ill ring your head like a bell shouldnt you be training too tell me mine well im hardly a new recruit how many brothers can say that theyve killed a white walker and a thenn i might be the first in history  shield up  these men need a firm hand always have theyre poachers and thieves not soldiers that one hates me if ser alliser is chosen as the new lord commander he hates the wildlings everyone wants to know their future all the wildlings dont let them send us away   its not a sure thing ser denys mallister has commanded the shadow tower for  years and people say hes a good man hes running against ser alliser sam dont let them send us away i told you wherever you go i go too you cant leave theyll execute you good good pivot dont forget to pivot  yah until they know their future shield up the king wants a word youre not cold my lady never the lords fire lives within me jon snow feel are you a virgin no good your grace if your father  hell never know were gone this is my fathers land my land the bastard of winterfell you know who rules at winterfell now roose bolton mmm the traitor who plunged a dagger in robb starks heart dont you want to avenge him i want a great many things your grace but im a sworn brother of the nights watch now ive been talking to your sworn brothers many of them love you  theyre good men many dont tell me my future or ill have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head you were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the wall why its where she belonged some of the nights watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings they were born on the wrong side of the wall that doesnt make them monsters no matter i shall take back the north from the thieves who stole it your blood tywin lannister is dead he cant protect them now i shall mount roose boltons head on a spike but if im to take winterfell i need more men the men of the nights watch are sworn to play no part im not talking about the damn nights watch im talking about the wildlings your grace you want the wildlings to march in your army if they swear to follow me ill pardon them well take winterfell once the north is won give me a taste ill declare them citizens of the realm ill give them land to live on its a fair offer more than fair ill offer them their lives and their freedom if mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty i dont think thats likely you admire him dont you i respect him  he likes you convince him to bend the knee  your grace or he burns three questions you get how much time do i have nightfall the sun drops fast this time of year hurry jon snow shield up  attack my lord attack dont cross your feet my sons had swords in their hands from the time they could walk this one you wont like the answers lord arryn will never be a great warrior great warrior he swings a sword like a girl with palsy my lord sword up my lord some boys develop more slowly hes still young hes  boys go to war at he has other gifts  does he the gift of a great name ive been promised to the prince sometimes thats all one needs goodbye lord royce and thank you for all youve done for me i have done nothing more than my duty my lady i have no doubt that on my return robins skills will have improved immeasurably hell be safe here as for his skills i make no promises will we head north at some point he said sansa had a brother at castle black when will we marry were a few days ride from the kingsroad but that will take us  us the only reason youre here is because jaime lannister told me you werent safe in the capital youre hundreds of miles from kings landing no one knows what you look like no one cares youre safe but im your squire  do you even know what a squire is an attendant to a knight im not a knight you will never wed the prince that means youre not a squire well where would i go i dont care im not your mother you swore to find the stark girls i found arya she didnt want my protection  sansa still might  will you shut your mouth i didnt ask for your advice i dont want anyone following me im not a leader all i ever wanted was to fight for a lord i believed in you will wed the king the good lords are dead and the rest are monsters you told lord royce we were going to the fingers i did but were heading west  we are if he wanted to betray us he already would have lord royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is but hes not alone in that castle do you trust all those knights and ladies stable boys and serving girls no do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us but if he finds out but i will be queen no but i pay them well and theyve seen what happens to men who disappoint me so where are we going to a land where you trust everyone to a land so far from here even cersei lannister cant get her hands on you it was such a deep deep shock to us all your father was a a force to be reckoned with oh yes he truly was i wouldnt presume to claim to have known him as such but but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with what a what a force to be reckoned with thank you so much for your kind words deepest condolences your grace this tragedy i never trusted varys i often warned youll be queen your grace cousin lancel i hardly recognized you my deepest sympathies i apologize for my sons appearance uncle its quite all right they call themselves sparrows bloody fanatics religion has its place of course but at a certain point they never would have come to the capital when tywin was alive for a time im sure hell grow out of it whatever it is excuse me  of course your wounds from the blackwater seem to have healed it wasnt my wounds that needed healing what can i do for you you can forgive me what could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness i led you into the darkness i doubt youve ever led anyone anywhere then comes another i tempted you into our unnatural relations and of course there was the king his boar hunt his wine i dont know what youre talking about im a different person now ive found peace in the light of the seven you can too they watch over all of us younger ready to dole out mercy or justice their world is at hand i will pray for your fathers soul the day tywin lannisters soul needs your help it looks like dorne  it doesnt it does thats the thats the sunspear bit right there and thats where the mountains are and over here is more beautiful is sunsnake stonespear sandstone yes yes sandstone just there fine its dorne we should go there i think we would have a lovely time to cast you down and take all you hold dear judging by my experience that would be wonderful dorne highgarden anywhere but here were late for dinner as it is youre very respectful im very hungry whats your name olyvar my lady im afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting olyvar wwill the king and i have children my lady perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet why they all know about me anyway everybody knows everything about everyone whats the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this in any event you shouldnt keep your intended waiting my intended please tywins dead that means no one can force cersei to marry me no the king will have  children and you will have three lucky you  unlucky you you think i want that woman married to my brother if she doesnt marry me she doesnt go to highgarden which means she stays in kings landing which means youre trapped here with cersei lannister as your mother by law perhaps perhaps perhaps eunuch the spider the master of whisperers imp halfman you dont need to be afraid of my father that doesnt make sense there are faster ways to kill yourself not for a coward you are many things my friend but not a coward you never told me why you set me free your brother asked me to could have said no refuse the kingslayer a dangerous proposition not as dangerous as releasing me you risked your life your position everything gold will be their crowns why youre not family you owe me nothing i didnt do it for you i did it for the seven kingdoms a drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the seven kingdoms i dont believe in saviors i believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come youre going to have to find another soldier im done with westeros and westeros is done with me you have many admirable qualities selfpity is not one of them gold their shrouds any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power but earning it for yourself that takes work im not wellsuited for work i think you are you have your fathers instincts for politics and you have compassion compassion yes i killed my lover with my bare hands i shot my own father with a crossbow come on we have to go i never said you were perfect what is it you want exactly peace prosperity a land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine the powerful have always preyed on the powerless thats how they became powerful in the first place perhaps we have to go cersei and perhaps weve grown so used to horror we assume theres no other way if you sat on the iron throne would you spread misery throughout the land i will never sit on the iron throne no you wont but you could help another climb those steps and take that seat the seven kingdoms need someone stronger than tommen but gentler than stannis bearers put it down a monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people a ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name good luck finding him who said anything about him you have a choice my friend you can stay here at illyrios palace and drink yourself to death or you can ride with me to meereen meet daenerys targaryen bearers up and decide if the world is worth fighting for can i drink myself to death on the road to meereen when did the unsullied start patrolling the streets of meereen looks like your friends havent been behaving themselves our mission to yunkai was a resounding success the wise masters of yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed men and the former slaveholders all matters of consequence will be brought to you for review good away they did ask for some concessions concessions politics is the art of compromise your grace im not a politician im a queen forgive me youre right of course still its easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones i dont expect the wise masters to be happy slavery made them rich i ended slavery they do not ask for the return of slavery they ask for the reopening of the fighting pits your grace we are honored by your presence the fighting pits where slaves fought slaves to the death in the new world that youve brought to us free men would fight free men the pit fighters you liberated plead for this opportunity bring some here and ask them yourself no fighting pits opening them would show the people of yunkai and meereen that you respect their traditions the mourners are waiting i do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting if you  how many times must i say no before you understand whatever he wants from me hes not going to get it if he really believes im going to reopen the fighting pits you should reopen the fighting pits what my mother was a whore i told you that she liked to drink pear brandy the older she got the less she made selling her body the more she wanted to drink are you sure they will keep waiting so one day when i was  she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before im sorry why i was a bad child i wasnt big but i was quick and i loved to fight so they sold me to a man in tolos who trained fighters for the pits i had my first match when i was you were sold into slavery i want a moment alone with him forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters and youre defending the fighting pits im only here because of those pits i learned to fight like a dothraki screamer a norvoshi priest a westerosi knight soon i was famous men and women screamed my name when i stepped into the pit i made so much money for my master he set me free when he died but your grace many of these lords and ladies have travelled i joined the second sons and then i met you youre the queen everyones too afraid of you to speak truth everyone but me youve made thousands of enemies all across the world as soon as they see weakness theyll attack show your strength here now thats why i have the unsullied patrolling the streets day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of unsullied youre not the mother of unsullied youre the mother of dragons i dont want another childs bones dropped at my feet no ones seen drogon in weeks for all i know hes flown halfway across the world i cant control them anymore a dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen viserion they will wait rhaegal easy easy easy so here we are here we are when we first met you were my prisoner and now for our last meeting this doesnt have to be our last meeting no but it will be you know what stannis wants he never wanted you to be a kingsguard he wants me to bend the knee and he wants the free folk to fight for him ill give him this much hes bold shouldnt a king be bold oh aye i respect him if he gets what he wants i expect hell be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the iron throne the last hundred years but here you are protecting his dead body but ill never serve him you told me you werent here to conquer you told me your people have bled enough thats right i dont want them bleeding for stannis baratheon either you spent your life convincing  clans to come together for the first time in history thenns and hornfoots the iceriver clans even the giants a lifes work uniting them you didnt do it for power what he built its ours you didnt do it for glory you brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter not if theyre north of the wall isnt their survival more important than your pride pride fuck my pride this isnt about that then bend the knee and save your people they followed me because they respected me he built it for us he meant it for us because they believed in me the moment i kneel for a southern king thats all gone and how many tens of thousands are out there right now how many women how many children and you wont go out and rescue them because why youre afraid of looking afraid oh i am afraid no shame in that how will they do it beheading hanging theyre going to try to take it away theyll burn you alive bad way to go ill be honest with you i dont want to die and burnt to death i dont want people to remember me like that scorched and screaming but its better than betraying everything i believe and what happens to your people yes all of it  they you preserve your dignity and die standing and theyll sing songs about you youd rather burn than kneel the great hero until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and theres no one left to sing youre a good lad truly you are but if you cant understand why i wont enlist my people in a foreigners war all of them out there our enemies theres no point explaining i think youre making a terrible mistake the freedom to make my own mistakes was all i ever wanted mance rayder youve been called the kingbeyondthewall westeros only has one king bend the knee i promise you mercy kneel and live this was my home for many years i wish you good fortune theyre waiting in line to make sure hes really dead in the wars to come we all must choose man or woman young or old lord or peasant our choices are the same we choose light or we choose darkness we choose good or we choose evil we choose the true god or the false free folk there is only one true king and his name is stannis and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes here stands your king of lies behold the fate of those who choose the darkness theyll set to work on tearing us apart they have nothing to do with it the man who murdered our father he tore us apart hes the enemy ive been telling you for years youve been defending him for years this is exactly what they want we shouldnt go in  of course we should and now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath did you set him free tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose you killed him by mistake with stupidity youre a man of action arent you when it occurs to you to do something you do it never mind the consequences get out get out take a look look at the consequences here they are he loved you more than anyone in this world apologies i still dont see why i had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail i saved your life if they catch you they catch me i cannot say i feel overly guilty lets go  no about leaving you in that fucking crate do you know what its like to stuff your shit through one of those airholes no i only know what its like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard pentos the home of my colleague illyrio mopatis a merchant he and i met many years ago through mutual friends ,3768

thank you this is my betrothed lollys a pleasure run along love beautiful young bride youve chosen when were you planning on getting married just get on with it  on with what you have everywhere else

better castle but wait return from where as far south as south goes my future queen the prince does not wish to be disturbed remove yourself from my path or ill take that longaxe and ill shove it captain let her pass your brother was murdered and you sit here in the water gardens cersei staring at the sky and doing nothing oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law that is not murder your brother  you dont have to remind me he was my brother long before he was anything to you what will you do about his death i will bury him i will mourn for him and then  you would have me go to war the whole country would have you go to war then we are lucky the whole country does not decide walder frey the sand snakes are with me they have the love of their people they will avenge their father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing oberyn is dead and this lannister girl skips about the water gardens eating our food breathing our air how many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill let me have her let me send her to cersei one finger at a time the mountain i loved my brother and you made him very happy for that you will always have a place in my heart but we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance not here not while i rule and how long will that be the unsullied are too conspicuous anyone can see you coming from a mile off of course you havent found any sons of the harpy meryn trant you havent have you my second sons on the other hand they drink they whore fight in the streets they blend in they overhear things in taverns follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys break a few fingers overhear a few more things before you know it in the old times whenever braavos stood in danger cersei no one here we go in a hurry youre afraid unsullied fear nothing right thats your problem you understood fear once long ago but youve forgotten what it means someone whos forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide walder frey fear is useful that way sons of the harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck on all of our necks please your grace you must kill him it would send a message i think you should exercise restraint your grace why  for one thing he may have valuable information the son of the harpy has no more valuable information how do you know that because i questioned him the mountain and the information you did get he is young and poor  he is born free why should he want to bring back slavery what did it do for him perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was they pay him great families afraid to do a thing they pay poor man to do it for them and how do you know this  everyone know this i dont know it and im the head of a great family meryn trant we do not know what this man did or didnt do give him a trial at least a fair trial show all the citizens of meereen that youre better than those who would depose you teach them a better way i do not know the place from where old ser comes things maybe are different there i hope but here in meereen before daenerys stormborn they own us so we learn much about them cersei walder frey or we do not live long they teach me what they are mercy fair trial these mean nothing to them all they understand is blood thank you all for your counsel your grace a word please i beg you about what  about your father about the mad king  the mad king youre here to remind me of my enemies lies consider me reminded the mountain your grace i served in his kingsguard i was at his side from the first your enemies did not lie go on when the people rose in revolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame he murdered sons in front of their fathers he burned men alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed and his efforts to stamp out dissent meryn trant led to rebellion that killed every targaryen except two im not my father no your grace thank the gods but the mad king gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the very end i will not have the son of the harpy executed without a fair trial your grace theres a bug cersei yes best be careful you might accidently consume some solid food when i agreed to come with you did i misrepresent my intentions besides what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box you dont like it  i want to take a walk you cant cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head walder frey she ought to offer her cunt best part of her for the best part of me well i suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere are we really going to spend the entire road to volantis talking about the futility of everything youre right no point the road to volantis you said we were going to meereen whats in volantis the road to meereen and what do you hope to find at the end of the road to meereen the mountain i told you a ruler weve already got a ruler everywhere has already got a ruler every pile of shit on the side of every road has someones banner hanging from it you were quite good you know at ruling during your brief tenure as hand i didnt rule i was a servant still a man of talent managed to kill a lot of people the titan would step with fire in his eyes meryn trant yes but you showed great promise in other areas as well she wanted me to leave kings landing she begged me i wouldnt go why cause i liked it power even as a servant people follow leaders and they will never follow us they find us repulsive cersei i find us repulsive and we find them repulsive which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away and yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box not for long youre right lets go for a walk  no walder frey how many dwarves are there in the world is cersei going to kill them all not him are you trying to deceive your queen shall i throw them in a cell your grace that wont be necessary ser meryn i dont want to dissuade the other hunters mistakes will be made thank you your grace thank you  your grace thank you take the head  pardon me your grace the mountain i would take it if you dont mind it could prove useful for my work very good over there will be fine you heard the man over there youre the hand of the king no uncle clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role im merely advising my son until he comes of age meryn trant and chooses a hand for himself your grace i would be willing to serve provisionally as the kings hand until he becomes old enough youre a good man lord tyrell but i dont imagine youll have the time in addition to being master of ships the king has appointed you master of coin oh your grace he called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled must be good food if its crowded he said he would be honored to have you represent the crowns interests in the same the honor is all mine your grace your grace in the past on several occasions a grand maester has served as the kings hand the king has named qyburn the new master of whisperers your grace him this this man this embarrassment to the citadel your grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post ale the qualification of loyalty grand maester thats far more than the eunuch ever had far more than many ever have i must say i cannot see uncle kevan in light of your position as commander of the lannister armies it would please the king if you would serve as his master of war no man living better deserves the title that is kind of you to say i would like to hear it from the king himself ale the king is very busy at this moment he should be here learning what it means to rule he is learning on this occasion in his capacity as ruler hes asked me to speak on his behalf i returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother and to you and to serve the king i did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet to watch you stack the small council with sycophants before we left a maester gave you a raven scroll sending your own brother away so he wouldnt be my brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission what mission that is not your concern as master of war i do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern you are the queen mother nothing more you would abandon your king in his time of need if he wants to send for me i will be waiting for him you are becoming an observant young lady at casterly rock come on you know this one it looks like an animal snake sssnake s its an s  right very good huh did you know that the youngest lord commander in history osric stark was elected at the age of i know s hed wade into the sea and smash the enemies my mother used to say dark wings dark words youll learn i promise i taught ser davos and old people are terrible at learning new things well youre a wonderful teacher very patient i only said that the more time that you spend practicing the faster youll be able to read thats all right were doing just fine im sure you and ostrich stark have a lot to talk about how old were you when you learned how to read an old saying inaccurate in this case three  three who taught you your mother no old maester cressen did i had a lot of time to practice my mother kept me inside because what do you call it in the south what happened to your face greyscale what do you call it north of the wall i dont know excuse me but two of my sisters had it they both died how did they cure you i dont remember i was a baby lots of people came and tried i think whatever they did it went away what happened to your sisters my father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside none of us were allowed to go near them so it was good news but we heard them especially at night they started to sound not like themselves did you ever see them only once at the end they were covered with it their faces their arms they acted like animals my father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope what did he do with them in the woods mother my marriage proposal has been accepted leave us your grace you need to stay away from that girl why  shes a wildling her name is gilly shes nice im teaching her to read shes a wildling your father defeated her people he executed their king for treason they could strike at him by striking at you i thought you still mourned the death of my beloved aunt lysa gilly wouldnt do that you have no idea what people will do all your books and you still dont know i ordered mance rayder burned at the stake you prevented that order from being carried out you showed mercy to mance rayder a kings word is law perhaps you should ask ser davos how much mercy i show to lawbreakers show too much kindness people wont fear you ale if they dont fear you they dont follow you with respect your grace the free folk will never follow you no matter what you do youre the man who burned their king alive who then you no only one of their own do you know this wretched girl lyanna mormont ill have some the lord commanders niece lady of bear island and a child of i asked her to commit her house to my cause thats her response bear island knows no king but the king in the north whose name is stark that amuses you i apologize your grace northerners can be a bit like the free folk loyal to their own  i know my brother robert went on often and loudly my lady about how difficult it was to control them even with your fathers help tonight the nights watch elect a new lord commander ser alliser thorne is going to win most likely  unpleasant man he thinks youre a traitor whats your life going to be like here at the wall with thorne in command unpleasant i expect your bravery made him look weak hell punish you for it what is it i dont punish men for bravery i reward them i dont doubt it your grace but im a brother of the nights watch i pledged them my life my honor my sword i dont know what i have left to give you you can give me the north i cant even if i wanted to im a bastard a snow hes just a statue sansa stark dont look kneel before me lay your sword at my feet pledge me your service and youll rise again as jon stark lord of winterfell hell make you a stark with the stroke of a pen its the first thing i ever remember wanting id daydream that my father would ask the king and just like that i would never be the bastard of winterfell again you deserve this you do i couldnt be happier for you im going to refuse him you sure but youd be lord of winterfell i swore a vow to the nights watch if i dont take my own word seriously what sort of lord of winterfell would i be crowded youd think we were serving venison stew does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the th lord commander of the nights watch ser alliser thorne is not just a knight shes dyed her hair but its her hes a man of true nobility he was acting commander when the wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings  hear hear hes a veteran of  battles and has been a defender of the watch and the wall almost all of his life aye hes the only true choice ser denys mallister joined the watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger through  winters he served shes sitting with petyr baelish as commander of the shadow tower he kept the wildlings away we could do no better if there is no one else we will begin the voting the triangular tokens count for ser alliser thorne the square tokens for ser denys mallister each brother will  maester aemon samwell tarly go on littlefinger sam the slayer another wildling lover just like his friend jon snow hows your lady love slayer her name is gilly brother slynt knows her quite well they cowered together in the larder during the battle for the wall lies a wildling girl a baby and lord janos i found him there after the battle was over a bunch of knights with him in a puddle of his own making whilst lord janos was hiding with the women and children jon snow was leading ser alliser fought bravely it is true and when he was wounded it was jon who saved us he took charge of the walls defense he killed the magnar of the thenns he went north to deal with mance rayder knowing it almost certainly meant his own death a bunch whats a bunch podrick six before that he led the mission to avenge lord commander mormont mormont himself chose jon to be his steward he saw something in jon and now weve all seen it too he may be young but hes the commander we turned to when the night was darkest i cant argue with any of that but who does jon snow want to command nights watch i think too many or the wildlings everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with mance rayder many times what would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if stanniss army hadnt come along we all saw him put the kingbeyondthewall out of his misery do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them it is time it appears to be a tie maester my lady i dont think this is the right jon snow jon snow jon snow jon snow you you what have you got there i said  turn around and go turn around and go thats a nice little sword worth  pieces a sword like that nothings worth anything to dead men come on quickly go go ready the horses  we only have one horse who are you why were they scared of you you lost this you said there was no jaqen hghar here there isnt a man is not jaqen hghar well who are you then no one and that is who a girl must become dont be afraid find more why do you like the taste i dont see what all the fuss is about mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa

some men courage mhysa  mhysa ill stand guard outside your door tonight your grace we all guard tonight leave me drogon does it give you courage thats far enough lord baelish lady sansa my name is brienne of tarth weve met with renly baratheon hes announcing our arrival what did he say about you he said your loyalty came free of charge someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then

bells all day and night remember anything you need we cant hold the north with terror alone i want to serve  you cant hold the north if you let these lesser lords insult us i sent you there to collect

wife and brother made his son watch and the new lord cerwyn paid his taxes a girl wants to serve herself ive something important to tell you stop eating and listen we dont have enough men to hold the north if the other houses rise up against us do you understand that our pact with the lannisters protects i had a pact with tywin lannister and tywin lannister is dead the remaining lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact theyve never once in the history of the seven kingdoms here we serve the manyfaced god sent their army this far north if you think they will for us youre a fool weve become a great house by entering into alliances with other houses and parlaying those alliances into greater power the best way to forge a lasting alliance isnt by peeling a mans skin off the best way is marriage now that youre a bolton by royal decree its high time you married a suitable bride to serve well and as it happens ive found the perfect girl to solidify our hold on the north thats moat cailin yes a bit shabby isnt it youve been here before on our way down to kings landing with my father and arya where are you taking me home the boltons have winterfell a girl must become

the horses around but listen to me listen youve been running all your life terrible things happen to your family and you weep you sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates youve been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father stop being a bystander do you hear me stop running i see the weirwood face theres no justice in the world not unless we make it you loved your family avenge them banners how do we get through there we dont we go around takes us miles out of the way well lose sight of them there is only one god doesnt matter i know where theyre going arent you getting a bit old to be a squire how did you end up squiring for the imp he hates that nickname well hes not here to complain about it is he i squired for a knight named ser lorimer during the war of the five kings one night he had a bit too much to drink and he was famished so he borrowed a ham a girl knows his name he borrowed it he wasnt a thief he was drunk and hungry and he wasnt thinking i was drunk too he gave me half the ham next morning one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the hambone still in his hand they hanged him that afternoon they tied the noose for me too but lord tywin heard my family name was payne and all men know his gift so he pardoned me and sent me to kings landing to squire for his son as punishment for both of you it didnt seem that way lord tyrion was always very good to me yes all your lords have been very kind to you all except me sorry you had to squire for such a nasty person im not sorry youre the best fighter ive ever seen you beat the hound where are they taking him im proud to be your squire im sorry im always snapping at you if you didnt snap at me i wouldnt learn anything you want to be a knight pod yes starting tomorrow well train with a sword twice a day before we ride in the morning and after you make camp in the evening and im going to show you how to ride properly  thank you i cant knight you but i can teach you how to fight i suppose thats more important queen margaery queen margaery you werent a knight but you were a kingsguard to renly baratheon werent you i was lord tyrion said he was a good man he was how did you end up serving renly when i was a girl my father held a ball im his only living child so he wanted to make a good match for me he invited dozens of young lords to tarth i didnt want to go but he dragged me to the ballroom queen margaery and it was wonderful none of the boys noticed how mulish and tall i was they shoved each other and threatened to duel when they thought it was their turn to dance they whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles my father smiled at me and i smiled at him i had never been so happy till i saw a few of the boys snickering and then they all started to laugh queen margaery they couldnt keep the game going any longer they were toying with me brienne the beauty they called me great joke and i realized i was the ugliest girl alive a great lumbering beast i tried to run away but renly baratheon took me in his arms dont let them see your tears he told me theyre nasty little shits valar dohaeris queen margaery and nasty little shits arent worth crying over he danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word renly was the kings brother after all but wasnt he lord tyrion said he was yes pod he liked men im not an idiot he didnt love me he didnt want me he danced with me because he was kind and didnt want to see me hurt he saved me from being a joke  i am his and he is mine   i am hers and she is mine from that day until his last day and i couldnt save him in return nothings more hateful than failing to protect the one you love one day i will avenge king renly but you said a shadow murdered him how do you fight a shadow a shadow with the face of stannis baratheon i know it was stannis i know it in my heart stannis is a man not a shadow and a man can be killed from this day until the end of my days lord commander  your grace id like to speak alone olly is my steward now as i was lord commander mormonts i want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience one day he might command very well have you considered my offer i have and i thank you for it you do me great honor did i hurt you all my life i wanted to be jon stark say the word and you will be but i have to refuse you im lord commander of the nights watch my place is here im giving you the chance to avenge your family to take back the castle where you grew up to rule the north i wish i could fight beside you believe me i do no you were lovely but i swore a sacred vow at the godswood i pledged my life to the nights watch youre as stubborn as your father i can imagine no higher praise i didnt mean it as praise honor got your father killed but if your minds made up i wont try and dissuade you may i ask your grace how long you plan to stay at castle black are you bored of us already you saved us from mance rayders army it all happened so fast  yes we will never forget that but its a question of survival the nights watch cant continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely winter is coming i know it we march on winterfell within the fortnight before the snows trap us here and the wildlings if theyd rather burn than fight for me so be it i was scared maybe i hurt you i leave their fate to you you could execute them thats the safest course or you could see if this tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than mance ever was i assume the brothers of the nights watch would rather see the wildlings dead most of the brothers yes theres little love for the free folk here youre the lord commander your decision you have many enemies in castle black it sounded like  no no no have you considered sending alliser thorne elsewhere give him command of eastwatchbythesea i heard it was best to keep your enemies close whoever said that didnt have many enemies he sees something in you might not be apparent from his tone but its the truth he believes in you im sorry i disappointed him the king is a complicated man youre very sweet but he wants to do whats right for the seven kingdoms as long as hes ruling them hes the one true king he has a blood right to that throne ive sworn to stay clear of the politics of the seven kingdoms have you now how does the nights watch vow go again ill bet youve got it memorized since you got here night gathers and now my watch begins no not that bit the bit at the end the sweetest king who ever lived i am the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the realms of men  i pledge my life  right thats enough the shield that guards the realms of men thats what you swore to be now im not a learned man but the best way to help the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world it just might mean wading in the muck ive been sweeping this floor for days this is all i want to do all day getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be done and what needs to be done as long as the boltons rule the north the north will suffer just one mans opinion what do you want who are you what  you who walk in here with a coin you never earned every day for the rest of my life whose value you do not respect who are you no one ow cunt a lie a sad little lie who are you i told you im no do that again and who are you youre about to find out what are you doing wouldnt that be glorious we were only playing the game of faces a girl is not ready  clearly not i

i give voice to the will of the gods and am their foremost servant in this world an insult to me is an insult to the gods an assault on my person is an assault on our very religion you were assaulted  i was by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows they humiliated me they beat me they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones i am lucky to be alive does queen margaery sound strange to you i heard this assault began in littlefingers brothel high septon this is a rather shocking thing to hear  i tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the mother so you were ministering to the needs of these devout prostitutes a mans private affairs ought to stay private what do you want from us high septon justice i ask that you protect our faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells i ask that you execute their leader so strange this socalled high sparrow hes a threat to everything we hold sacred if he goes unpunished  and where do i find this man this high sparrow i dont think this is a good idea your grace nonsense ser meryn these are deeply religious people where can i find the high sparrow seven blessings  thank you  just a little more thank you husband  wife thank you a young man said id find the high sparrow back here where is he  high sparrow sounds ridiculous doesnt it like lord duckling or king turtle still its meant to were often stuck with the names our enemies give to us the notion that were all equal in the eyes of the seven doesnt sit well with some so they belittle me sometimes it feels odd seven blessings to you my dear its only a name quite an easy burden to bear far easier than hers why no shoes because i gave them away to someone who needed them more we all do that it stops us from forgetting what we really are is that why you came to kings landing to remind everyone im the king everyone hard enough job reminding myself well i tell them no ones special and they think im special for telling them so perhaps theyre right it would be comforting to believe that wouldnt it have the gods sent you here to tempt me i hope not i had assumed youd only come here to arrest me for that incident with the high septon an unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative ive married the most beautiful woman in the world of the gods in this world wouldnt you say hypocrisy is a boil lancing a boil is never pleasant although they could have been more careful with the blade the high septon came to speak to me today he doesnt want me to arrest you he wants me to execute you i wouldnt presume to know your thoughts on the matter my thoughts on the matter are in line with your own the high septons behavior was corrosive as was his attitude i didnt come here to sweep floors and its all because my brother died having a man like that reside in the sept eats away at the faith from the inside so now he resides in the red keep dungeons instead the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other we must do everything necessary to protect one another your grace   send a raven with this message to littlefinger at the eyrie or wherever hes slithering about at once your grace hows your work coming along i understand very well youve made progress more than i expected still a way to go but  very good ill leave you to it then make sure littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word immediately shh easy friend she really is lovely i hope i can make her happy but its not your fault you know that dont you i hope so too ive become quite fond of lady sansa during our travels together shes suffered enough ill never hurt her you have my word ive heard very little about you which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go i havent been a lord very long i was a bastard and youre not anymore you mustnt feel guilty allow me a moment alone with lord baelish yes father and thank you lord baelish im forever in your debt he seems pleased shouldnt he be i assure you shes still a virgin tyrion never consummated the marriage by the law of the land she is no mans wife inspect her if you must i dont feel guilty ill leave that to the brothel keeper its her name i need not her virtue then i have delivered everything i promised and youre prepared for the consequences when the lannisters hear ive wed sansa stark to ramsay the lannister name doesnt mean what it once did tywin is dead he kept his house in power through sheer will without him jaime has one hand and no allies tommen is a soft boy thats whats odd not a king to fear the queen will be enraged queen margaery adores sansa cersei is queen mother a title whose importance wanes with each passing day and yet she still has friends men in important places whom she can ask for favors a message for you from cersei lannister a rider arrived from the eyrie shortly before dawn apparently she thinks youre still in the vale do you like to sail a message for me you say strange that the seal is broken im sure you understand my position lord baelish if you receive word in the night from the queen mother it does make me question our new alliance the lannisters made you one of the great lords of westeros yet here you are in the north undermining them why gamble with your position every ambitious move is a gamble you gambled when you drove a dagger into robb starks heart i love to sail it appears that your gamble paid off youre warden of the north i had tywin lannisters backing who supports me now you the eyrie is mine the last time the lords of the eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the north they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known id like to borrow one of your birds cersei will expect a reply i do too id

roose boltons the warden of the north he murdered my brother but i dont imagine well get to stick around for the rest we swore to be the watchers on the wall we cant watch the wall with  men and we cant get more men without help from the warden of the north apologies my lady lord commander how can i help you come with us when we ride south none of us know the castle as well as you do its hidden tunnels its weaknesses not after weve kidnapped their princess its people winterfell was your home once dont you want to chase the rats out of it castle black is my home now the nights watch take no part in the wars of the seven kingdoms theres only one war life against death come let me show you what youre fighting for youre gonna show me some vision in the fire forgive me my lady i dont trust in visions were not kidnapping their princess no visions no magic just life do you feel my heart beating theres power in you you resist it and thats your mistake embrace it the lord of light made us male and female two parts of a greater whole in our joining theres power power to make life were rescuing my niece bringing her back to her family power to make light and power to cast shadows i dont think stannis would like that very much then we shouldnt tell him i cant  why i swore a vow i loved another the dead dont need lovers only the living i know your niece but i still love her you know nothing jon snow are you lonely just bored my father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources were you bored a lot too i know castle black is no place for a child but i like it i thought id be left at home ive been doing this sort of thing a long time i know mother didnt want to bring me why do you say that she told me i dont want to bring you she shouldnt have said that are you ashamed of me father when you were an infant a dornish trader landed on dragonstone his goods were junk except for one wooden doll he had even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house no doubt he had heard of your birth im good at it  thats why youre here and assumed new fathers were easy targets i still remember how you smiled when i put that doll in your cradle how you pressed it to your cheek by the time we burned the doll it was too late i was told you would die or worse the greyscale would go slow let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of valyria i know why are you here to live out your short life with the stone men before the sickness spread through the castle i told them all to go to hell i called in every maester on this side of the world every healer every apothecary they stopped the disease and saved your life cause you did not belong across the world with the bloody stone men you are the princess shireen of house baratheon and you are my daughter tarth ser jaime why not send  of me or an army i thought i might find you here your aunt lyanna father never talked about her sometimes id find him down here lighting the candles they say she was beautiful i saw her once i was a boy living with your mothers family lord whent held a great tourney at harrenhal everyone was there the mad king your father unlike most folks youve actually got one robert baratheon and lyanna she was already promised to robert you can imagine what it was like for me a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name watching these legendary men tilting at the lists the last two riders were barristan selmy and rhaegar targaryen when rhaegar won everyone cheered for their prince because i dont want to start a war i remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair how handsome he was until he rode right past his wife elia martell and all the smiles died ive never seen so many people so quiet he rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in lyannas lap blue as frost that still doesnt explain what youre doing here how many tens of thousands had to die because rhaegar chose your aunt yes he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her come lets speak somewhere the dead cant hear us youre dressed for riding i am where are you going kings landing it has to be me kings landing cersei sent for me we mustnt let her sniff out any trouble you cant leave me here i know how hard it is to live with people you despise believe me but it wont be for long how do you know stannis baratheon garrisons at castle black hell march south to kings landing if im putting something like this together before the winter snows block his way but first he has to take winterfell you dont know that  i do once he liberates these lands from the boltons hell rally your fathers bannermen to his cause with the north behind him stannis can finally take the iron throne you think hell defeat the boltons he has a larger army hes the finest military commander in westeros a onehanded man who happens to be a betting man would put his money on stannis as it happens i am a betting man and if youre right stannis takes winterfell he rescues you from the most despised family in the north grateful for your late fathers courageous support of his claim he names you wardeness of the north but i i wouldnt wardeness of the north one of the most recognizable faces in westeros is not you are the last surviving stark he needs you and what if youre wrong what if stannis never attacks winterfell or he does and the boltons defeat him then you will take this bolton boy ramsay and make him yours i dont know how to do that of course you do hes already fallen for you it has to be me his father frightens me he should hes a dangerous man but even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered and youve learned to maneuver from the very best ill return before too long youll be strong without me the north will be yours do you believe me i expect ill be a married woman by the time you return breakfast you set your brother free didnt you that would have been a shit way to die as far as ive seen theyre all shit ways to die aye but your lot have to give the singers a good ending i dont care whats sung about me when im dead no two knights off to rescue a princess sounds like a good song to me sounds like all the rest what about you what shit way would you choose the sapphire isle ill bet your sister didnt like that in my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune how disappointing i thought youd have something more exciting planned ive had an exciting life i want my death to be boring how do you want to go in the arms of the woman i love she want the same thing lets go varys set him free the captain of that ship what was he braavosi pentoshi and hes headed to oldtown as i said why whats to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that jaime lannister is in dorne a bag of gold im not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world well if you ever see the wee fucker it was a heavy bag and i bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it but you wont be around if he breaks em how many you count four how many do you think you can take one if hes slow halt over the hill fucked in the ass give him my regards hyah morning lads glad we found you who are you cooper this is darnell youre from kings landing accent gave me away flea bottom whelped and whipped why are you here he murdered my father our ship capsized in the night we managed to swim ashore it was a near thing really thought the sharks would get us there are no sharks in dorne could have sworn those were shark fins dolphins maybe throw your swords in the sand boys theres no need for this just point us in the right direction if i ever see him ill split him in two well find our way home swords in the sand now hyah hyah that one should be slow enough nice move luck you had a wonderful teacher always wanted a dornish stallion beasts can run a day and night without tiring well ride to the water gardens and then ill give him your regards with a nice breeze in our faces first we need to bury these bodies birds have to eat too corpses raise questions questions raise armies were not here to start a war do you know how long itll take us to dig all those holes i cant dig very well with one hand not at all really mama nym obara the iron bank has called in onetenth of the crowns debts will it be war prince doran will weep for your father but nothing else we must avenge oberyn ourselves without doran we have no army to march against the lannisters we dont need an army to start a war queen cersei loves her children and we have one of them you may have a problem a ships captain who found me in planky town claiming he had information to sell given the expense of rebuilding the royal fleet he told me he smuggled jaime lannister into dorne hes come for myrcella if he gets to her before we do we lose our only chance for revenge you must choose dorans way and peace or my way and war im with you always nym obara how much can the crown afford when i was a child oberyn came to take me to court i had never seen this man and yet he called himself my father my mother wept said i was too young and a girl oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said girl or boy we fight our battles but the gods let us choose our weapons my father pointed to the spear and then to my mothers tears why are we on a merchant ship with winter coming i made my choice long ago will you untie me will you please untie me will you please thank you who are you your captor do you have wine no cant sleep without wine half what they ask less then stay awake youre going the wrong way my sister is in westeros westeros is west were heading east im not taking you to your sister you said you were taking me to the queen i am queen daenerys targaryen shes the queen i serve what a waste of a good kidnapping youre the master of coin how do we pay them it so happens i was heading there myself what business would you have with the queen gold and glory oh and hate if youd ever met my sister youd understand so now that its clear we are on the same side a highborn knight from the north of westeros down on his luck in essos dragon epaulets bear sigil breastplate youre jorah mormont i have to ask house tyrell could front the gold how exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away is it possible that you were running why would you be running and why would she have sent you away oh wait you were spying on her werent you its all coming back to me i was drunk through most of the small council meetings but its all coming back and the crown would pay us back in time you passed notes to varyss little birds she found out didnt she found out and exiled you now you hope to win back her favor with a gift risky scheme one might even say desperate you think daenerys will execute me and pardon you id say the reverse is just as likely everyone looks happy enough from up here what or id have words with my daughter i was thinking about all the times your brother made me go with him down from the red keep into the streets of kings landing why  he liked to walk among the people he liked to sing to them he sang to them yes rhaegar would pick a spot on the hook or the street of seeds and then hed sing just like all the other minstrels youve already given us too much and what did you do i made sure no one killed him and i collected the money what he liked to see how much he could make he was good  he was very good viserys never told you he told me rhaegar was good at killing people rhaegar never liked killing he loved singing and what did you do with the money no we must arrange better terms with the iron bank well one time he gave it to the next minstrel down the street one time he gave it to an orphanage in flea bottom one time we got horribly drunk your grace hizdahr is here waiting in the audience chamber how many others are there will you be joining us ser barristan i think i can protect you from hizdahr zo loraq i think i can protect me from hizdahr zo loraq absolutely  in person go ser barristan sing a song for me your grace all men must die but not all can die in glory glory  why else do men fight why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea and conquer the seven kingdoms so their names would live on those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on me  we must send an envoy to the iron bank its the best chance theyll ever have is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport your grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season i do not recognize this tradition traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment why no lannister sails someone of importance to show these bankers our respect i cant promise this is the answer to all our problems but its a start as the kings master of coin i can think of no one more qualified i would be honored your grace the kings expressed concern about his fatherinlaws safety on this voyage hes ordered ser meryn to personally lead your escort my very own kingsguard please express my  safe travels lord tyrell of course of course ill give your regards to the titan of braavos the small council grows smaller and smaller this ships sailing to oldtown not small enough may i offer you some wine your holiness no the old high septon would have asked the vintage i could say that our minds are temples to the seven and should be kept pure but the truth is i dont like the taste hmm how may i serve all over westeros we hear of septs being burned well get off earlier not far from sunspear silent sisters raped bodies of holy men piled in the streets wars teach people to obey the sword not the gods perhaps the gods need a sword of their own in the days before the targaryens the faith militant dispensed the justice of the seven well the faith militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago if i explain their holy purpose to my son the king i have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy row ourselves to the dornish shore in the night an army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people an army in service to the gods themselves and to you of course as the chosen representative of the seven an honor i never expected or indeed ever wished for which is why you were chosen you and i both know how the world works too often the wicked are the wealthiest beyond the reach of justice ,3602
44,5,8.7,5,secure it and use it as a base from which to operate is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them and how many of your people cant fight the women the children the old the sick what happens to them youre condemning them to death worse than death because youre too proud to make peace or maybe youre not proud maybe youre just a coward easy thing to say to a man in

its all right you dont mean it do you telling the wildlings you want to make peace youre just doing it to trick them its not a trick they burned my village they put an arrow through my fathers head no

for you from the way shes carrying maester wolkan says it looks like a boy how can you be sure sure of what that shes pregnant i mean of the former slaves is secure how can you tell maester wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt so how did you manage it manage what getting her pregnant i imagine youre familiar with the procedure of course but how did you find it you disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the stark girl she sounds like quite a woman and if its a boy youre worried about your position my position is quite clear im your son until a better alternative comes along youve never asked me about your mother why would i she had me she died and here we are she was a peasant girl and shes alone pretty in a common sort of way she was the millers wife apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent so i had him hanged and i took her beneath the tree where he was swaying she fought me the whole time she was lucky i didnt hang her too a year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms a baby she claimed was mine under siege i nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river but then i looked at you and i saw then what i

with a dagger made of dragonglass dragonglass what the maesters call obsidian i know what it is we have it in dragonstone why would obsidian kill a walker i dont know ive been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something and all ive learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass the lady melisandre told me that death marches on the wall is a terrible thing ive seen it your grace seen what the army of the dead and when they come  we have to know how to fight them keep reading samwell tarly its time uh your grace wouldnt it be better to wait when jon snow returns with the wildlings we could have thousands more men if jon snow returns with the wildlings maester aemon we cant wait that long we have the advantage more men more horses all fed and rested but every day we wait the odds shift in boltons favor this could turn to winter at any moment we have to act now give the order we march at sunrise ill choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess no need theyre coming with us its a tough road ahead your grace lord commander wont they be safer  here half these watchmen are killers and rapists no they march with us as you wish your grace  do you think father will let me go down into the crypt beg your pardon at winterfell all the kings in the north are buried there bran the builder and king dorren and first things

feeling i need those ships youll get them back i swear it have a safe journey your grace and thank you mount up colors no youre still too weak he crossed a continent to serve me oh like a hundredyearold man ser barristan are you ashamed you were ambushed outnumbered there was no way you could have known slowly freezing to death this is not why wounded in war there is no shame for this i am ashamed because when the knife go in and i fall to the ground i am afraid all men fear death no not death i fear i need your advice i never again see missandei from the island of naath now you have given the masters what they deserve if i give everyone what they deserve ill have no one left to rule ser barristan counseled mercy when i took this city right up to the morning he died daario naharis thinks i should kill the former masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself what do you think your grace i think that i am not fit theres something i want to do something i to have an opinion on these matters you are as fit as anyone i know you know why im here and you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart so what do you think i can only tell you what i have seen your grace i have seen you listen to your counselors i have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you and i have seen you ignore your counselors have to do because there was a better choice one that only you could see my my queen please do not do this what about valar morghulis i did not want to die a coward apparently i do not want to die at all it takes courage to admit fear and to admit a mistake i came here to tell you that i was wrong i was wrong and you were right but itll divide the nights watch about tradition about bringing the people of this city together i will reopen the fighting pits to free men only slavery will never return to meereen not while i live yes my queen and in order to forge a lasting bond with the meereenese people i will marry the leader of an ancient family thankfully a suitor is already on his knees dont worry bitterly ill be fine nothing broken i dont think where are we now not the rhoyne long sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face the mormont way lets start over i apologize for before my mouth sometimes runs away from me this doesnt have to be an unpleasant trip half the men will hate me the moment i give the order were going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to meereen we are what would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine no wine i am a person who drinks people who drink need to keep drinking otherwise theyre not i know where we are youre taking us through valyria half the men hate you already lord commander i am have you sailed this route before no youre going to bring daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case im not enough i think youll be plenty you know what they say the doom still rules valyria what about the demons and the flames arent you afraid of the doom do it no but pirates are oh the smoking sea how many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again thousands of years the valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything and then and then they werent he was a loyal friend but you dont know what it is and then they werent they held each other close and turned their backs upon the end the hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes a fly upon a wall the waves the sea wind whipped and churned that doesnt matter the city of a thousand years and all that men had learned; the doom consumed it all alike and neither of them turned i would clap i suppose this is it then this is what remains what was that stone men dont let them touch you you do get behind mormont cut me free mormont mormont mormont tyrion tyrion tyrion tyrion youre all right you will find little joy in your command youre heavier than you look did any of them touch you you ive seen greyscale before but nothing like that i suppose thats why they send them there itd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it thank you for saving me of course i wouldnt have needed saving if you hadnt kidnapped me in the first place but with luck so what now we walk up the coast with luck well find a fishing village maybe another boat without luck weve got a long walk ahead of us ill get some wood for a fire try to get some rest huh thats the best idea youve had all day you will find the strength to do what needs to be done kill the boy jon snow winter is almost upon us kill the boy and let the man be born and he died in an alley where are the rest of the free folk now where have they gone who leads them they followed mance they wont follow anyone else what about you hard to lead when youre in chains what if i unchained you why would you do that because you are not my enemy butchered by cowards who hide behind masks and im not yours you sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends for  years the nights watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men and for  years weve fallen short of that oath you belong to the realms of men all of you and now everything is going to change it is  why now because now i am lord commander of the nights watch we could pull back to the pyramid district what would you have me do lord commander id have you go north of the wall gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here ill open the gates for them and let them through ill find them lands to settle south of the wall they wont kneel for you and neither will i i dont want them to kneel for me i want them to fight with me when the time comes the day i ask my people to fight with the crows ,3538
45,6,8.1,5,what are they doing with the bodies game i only know what i heard how he was leading an expedition beyond the wall there was a mutiny he was murdered by his own men we better keep moving valar morghulis valar dohaeris i have nowhere else to go ive taken her to every healer in braavos the game the game of faces ive spent every penny i had she suffers every day of her life i just want it to end it hurts i know dont be afraid i used to be like you i was sick i was dying but my father never gave up on me you tried already you failed he loved me more than anything in the world just like your father loves you so he brought me here my father prayed to the manyfaced god and i drank the water from his fountain it healed me ive devoted my life to him now you dont want to hurt anymore drink i didnt even know i was playing is a girl ready to give up her ears her nose her tongue her hopes and dreams her loves and hates all that makes a girl who she is forever no a girl is not ready to become no one but she is ready to become someone else why daenerys why is she worth all this as i recall the mormonts fought against the targaryens who are you during roberts rebellion do you believe in anything i believe in lots of things in something greater than ourselves i mean the gods destiny do you believe theres a plan for this world no neither did i i was a cynic just like you then i saw a girl step into a great fire no one with three stone eggs when the fire burned out i thought id find her blackened bones instead i saw her daenerys alive and unhurt holding her baby dragons have you ever heard baby dragons singing no its hard to be a cynic after that doesnt mean shes going to be a great queen no it doesnt the targaryens are famously insane get back to work what if she conquers the world then what years of peace and prosperity first we have to conquer the world we all right lets assume your dreams come true shes ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf she hacks off my head and restores your position you command her army sail to westeros defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the iron throne who are you hurrah long live the queen then what then she rules so a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in westeros becomes the ruler of westeros thats justice shes the rightful heir  why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king thats a slave ship  why are they anchored they probably came ashore for  water got a lot of fight in you huh what are you doing here how did you get here salt mines yeah that or a galley slave he looks strong enough what about the dwarf worthless cut his throat wait wait wait wait wait lets discuss this and then chop off his cock well sell it for a fortune a dwarfs cock has magic powers im from westeros just like you wait wait wait wait wait you cant just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it he has to know it came from a dwarf and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf it will be a dwarfsized cock guess again the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant queen daenerys has outlawed slavery get back to work daughter of a lord just like you were bound for volantis not slavers bay besides she reopened the fighting pits ive never heard of free men fighting in the pits the fighting pits in meereen youre in luck then youre about to be rich you are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms him him hes got to be  years old sure hes a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long except i was an only child we can all see that but he is a veteran of  battles they wrote songs about him that true he won the tournament at lannisport unseating ser jaime lannister himself the kingslayer jousting youre talking about jousting a fancy game for fancy lads the men who fight in the pits of meereen will swallow him whole i killed a dothraki bloodrider in single combat heir to his fortune liar its no lie his name was qotho he was bloodrider to khal drogo take me to slavers bay put a sword in my hand ill prove my worth for my children money lord baelish yes lancel lannister brother lancel my mother died we abandon our family names quite a family to abandon the city has changed since you were here last we flooded the gutters with wine smashed the false idols and set the godless on the run well done im here on urgent business for the queen mother should i send word that ill be delayed step carefully lord baelish my father remarried and his new wife youll find theres little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new kings landing we both peddle fantasies brother lancel mine just happen to be entertaining do you think its wise your grace arresting the heir to highgarden the faith arrested the heir to highgarden of course and the faith were armed on your orders the kings orders is the king to blame for ser lorass perversion gave birth to a girl house tyrell wont tolerate this insult house tyrell wont tolerate it im the insulted party lord baelish ser loras was promised to me instead he chose the company of boys ones choice of companion is a curious thing most curious lysa arryn for instance thoroughly repellant woman forgive me my stepmother didnt want any rivals for her precious daughter i know youre still in mourning lysa was a good woman a kind woman she was neither of those things we both know it still i pity her son how fortunate the young lord of the vale has a new father to counsel him i know how hard it can be to lose both your parents at such a young age if war comes to westeros will the knights of the vale fight for their king so she tried to kill me with poison young lord robin heeds my advice and i have always counseled loyalty to the throne good if theres nothing else there is another matter your grace something so urgent i couldnt trust the words to a raven you once charged me with finding arya stark to my shame i failed you but i have found sansa stark alive and well and home again i found out living at winterfell thats not possible my sources are well placed they tell me roose bolton plans to marry her to his son ramsay a bastard recently legitimized by king tommen roose bolton is warden of the north by the grace of my father indeed his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart we were fools to trust a turncloak marrying his son to the last of the starks sought help from the faceless men gives him more legitimacy in the north than an alliance with a hated southern house i will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on their bloody sigil i would counsel patience your grace patience sansa helped murder my son roose bolton is a traitor stannis baratheon is also a traitor marching with his army on winterfell no ive been here for weeks and my father was widowed again let stannis and roose battle let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when theyre done seize winterfell from whichever thief survives winterfell is  miles away from here the weather has already begun to turn that is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds surely your uncle kevan could muster a force my uncle kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse ser jaime then ive been serving them ever since jaimes away on a sensitive diplomatic mission i have no idea when hell be back perhaps i can help the knights of the vale are some of the best fighters in westeros trained to battle in the ice and the snow forgive me lord baelish you have a reputation as a moneylender and a brothel keeper not a military man you wouldnt risk a single lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury was that true or a lie what do you have to lose a brothel keeper and if you succeed name me warden of the north ill speak to the king this evening have him issue a royal decree ill not rest until the lion flies over winterfell and ill know youre a man of your word when i see sansa starks head on a spike as i said what i live to serve im going to ask him tomorrow what if he says no  he wont weve waited long enough i want you to be my wife now what is it do you want to marry me because our families arranged it or do you we cant not yet did you believe every word i said why not you know why not someone will see you are going to be my wife i am going to be your husband were allowed to walk through the gardens together how many other girls have you walked through these gardens i like the way your eyes go squinty when youre jealous they do not go squinty and you didnt answer the question they make a lovely couple a lannister and a martell get back to work they have no idea how dangerous that is we must protect them yes my prince you havent had to use that axe of yours in a long time i hope you remember how i remember how  ua the dornishmans wife was as fair as the sun ua ua and her kisses were warmer than spring ua ua the dornishmans blade ua ua it was made of black steel ua who are you ua and its kiss was a terrible thing ua ua the dornishmans wife would sing as she bathed ua ua in a voice that was sweet as a peach ua  all right thats enough im coming to the best part were trying to blend in dont want everyone in dorne to hear your accent this song really is all about the ending it can wait there thats the water gardens and once weve got the princess then what who are you i like to improvise that explains the golden hand unbowed unbent unbroken for oberyn for oberyn well shes made herself at home myrcella uncle jaime i i dont understand

whole it would have been a good fight im not scrubbing one more corpse westeros you fight pretty good for a little girl halt oh you can smell the shit from five miles away well why have we stopped go on rumors and gossip thats all theyve got its theater nothing more if they arrested all the pillow biters in kings landing thered be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else everyone knew about him and renly renly baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the seven kingdoms my family home is winterfell everyone knew no one cared but he was the kings brother and loras is the queens brother no no no no this is unacceptable cerseis behind it  yeah of course she is she wants to drag our name through the dirt put us in our place get some rest dear you look appalling let me deal with cersei lannister your grace i have travelled a long way im the youngest daughter of a great lord you must be exhausted put the pen down dear we both know youre not writing anything ah yes the famously tarttongued queen of thorns and the famous tart queen cersei i beg your pardon i know youre behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson if you apologize for that comment perhaps ill youll get your apology when i get loras i was as shocked as anyone when the faith arrested ser loras eddard stark i have no love for these fanatics but what can a queen mother do has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies i can assure you our alliance with house tyrell remains do you expect the alliance to continue after youve thrown our future into prison as i said i didnt imprison anyone he died in battle as for your veiled threats what veil the lannistertyrell alliance brought peace to a wartorn country do you really want to see the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare i didnt trust your father i didnt particularly like him but i respected him he was no fool he understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them house lannister has no rival a lie the high septon has called for an inquest not a trial just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against loras have merit which im sure they dont loras will be freed our happy alliance will continue and well forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened good day lady olenna you are aware of the rumors concerning you and renly i dont pay attention to rumors you were said to be despondent when he died after he was executed i fled the capital witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside even as stanniss army closed in he was my friend he was my king wasnt joffrey your king he was anointed by the seven not renly i was wrong to support renlys claim i know that but i was forgiven by joffrey i fought for him at the battle of blackwater yes wearing renlys armor why does it matter what i wore had to kill a stable boy do you deny all the charges against you fornication buggery blasphemy of course i deny them you never lay with renly baratheon never nor any other man never that will be all ser loras well i think thats quite enough of that drove my sword through his back the faith calls queen margaery forward you call me forward yes we have some questions for you i am the queen  you are and according to the law of the seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest how do you respond to these charges against your brother they are lies all of them  all of them a lie queen margaery in the presence of the gods do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge yes i swear it thank you your grace do you know this man yes very well he is ser loras tyrell heir to highgarden until you tell me why im doing it i stabbed him in the gut how did you come to meet i squired for him he took a liking to me he summoned me to his chamber the first day we met and what occurred in his chamber we engaged in intimate relations you lay with him that night and many others liar hes a liar is there anyone else who can support your claim i tried to find my mother and brother yes yes queen margaery she walked in on us once not long ago she didnt seem surprised this testimony is an insult to a great house why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden  he has a birthmark your grace quite high on his thigh winecolored and roughly the shape of dorne but i never did no liar what are you doing let us pass the faith is satisfied there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for ser loras and queen margaery what bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any my lady take her they were murdered by walder frey no tommen tommen you cant do this i am the queen tommen tommen i am your queen how dare you take your hands off me tommen what do you want lord ramsay sent me to draw you a bath my lady you want to be clean and fresh an outlaw kidnapped me a man called polliver for your new husband dont you youre so beautiful but you need to keep him happy ramsay gets bored easily you dont want to end up like well like the others what others i shouldnt gossip oh its good to see the

company therefore do you ever shut up i sailed from kings landing to pentos in a crate without ever saying a word get back to work why it never occurred to you to ask why until now you never wondered why tyrion lannister decided to visit a brothel in volantis im sure you visited many brothels in many cities i killed my father he wanted to execute me for a crime i didnt commit and he was fucking the woman i loved as miserable as you are mormont at least your father was a good man when do i get to play the game what do you know about my father i met him i visited the wall when i asked him about his men he knew all their stories every one of them he actually cared about the people under his command how do they put it in the watch we shall never see his like again oh you didnt know im

so do you deny a part in all this cersei summoned me to kings landing i dared not refuse her and what did she want egg a piece of information she knew that i had neither silence nor lies were an option but i have other information of which she is unaware and as you say our interests are aligned i have a gift for you what kind of gift the same kind i gave cersei a handsome young man many worthy fighters have died egg trying to make it to the great games when most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station but if you do happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of daznak itself in front of the queen so whatever happens the gods have smiled upon you today this is the day your lives actually start to mean something you and you you you two mothers looking for you you you and you up  valar morghulis  valar dohaeris prepare yourselves sitting through the great games will be bad enough for generations in the days leading up to the great games it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds of the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence move yourselves egg your grace your future grace you honor us all stand there stand straight thats the fucking queen we fight and die for your glory o glorious queen we fight and die for your glory o glorious queen fight get some sleep sam i think ive seen enough your grace it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged ive sacrificed more than enough for your traditions what are you doing wait your turn you piece of fucking filth get him out of my sight khaleesi please i just need a moment of your time i brought you a gift youll have to speak for him tomorrow its true he has who are you i am the gift its a pleasure to meet you your grace my name is tyrion lannister this is horrible unacceptable are they feeding you enough at least i brought you this venison who have died fighting the wildlings you dont know that its quite good i had it myself for supper only last night we did everything we could from the moment they took your brother tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow but i fear the faith has left reason behind i know you did this we are making every effort on your behalf i swear to you by all the seven gods lies come easily to you get some sleep everyone knows that but innocence decency concern youre not very good at those im afraid perhaps thats why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me youre upset youre not thinking clearly ill visit again when youve had a chance to calm down i dont want to see you again ill watch over him i do hope you change your mind about that ive been told men often go mad in the black cells beneath the red keep though i suppose your isolation will end when your trial begins leave yes im afraid i must my son needs me now more than ever get out you hateful bitch im staying too sleep well sister thank you boake you saw her  yes and  her accommodations seem sufficient what happens to her now well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion a trial will be held for each of them to determine if theyre guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith hes always been good to me who will stand judge seven septons as it was in all trials before the targaryens will you be one of them i will if one or both of them were to confess before the trial then they will be shown the mothers mercy and what does the mothers mercy entail it depends upon the situation the acts themselves the degree of contrition i cant leave him now thank you high septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the seven did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in kings landing i think i may have heard at one point baelor built his sept around it but men worshipped here long before him who carved this altar do you know  im afraid i dont egg no one does theres no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel no the people who built this place didnt inflict their vanity on those who came after them the way baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there hmm their faith was clean strip away the gold and the ornaments knock down the statues and the pillars and this is what remains egg something simple and solid and true the tyrells finery will be stripped away their lies knocked down their true hearts laid bare for all to see and so it will be for all of us high and low alike what will we find when we strip away your finery a young man came to us not long ago i dreamed broken in body and spirit he had so much to strip away so much weighing him down but piece by piece he unburdened himself let go of vanity pride sin now his soul is so light he will float through the seven heavens like a bird hmm and he has much to say about you that i was old move let me go immediately you will order her to let me go i am the queen i am the queen have you lost your mind let me go get your filthy hands off me have you lost your mind i am the queen let me go look at me as always thank you for your honesty his name was aemon targaryen look at my face its the last thing youll see before you die he came to us from kings landing a maester of the citadel chained and sworn and sworn brother of the nights watch ever faithful no man was wiser or gentler or kinder at the wall a dozen lord commanders came and went during his years of service but he was always there to counsel them he was the blood of the dragon safe travels lord commander but now his fire has gone out and now his watch is ended and now his watch is ended youre losing all your friends tarly my beautiful wife when my father told me we were marrying i half expected a fat bearded beast do you know how pleased i was when i saw you youve made me very happy our scouts report that stannis baratheon rides for winterfell thank you sam hes a respected commander his troops are loyal and battletested hes hired thousands of foreign sellswords to bolster his army but this storm is a stroke of luck for us northerners our people are used to fighting in the frost his army is out there now suffering in the snow one day ill be lord of winterfell and warden of the north youll be my lady and wardeness but isnt your stepmother pregnant ,4134
47,8,9.9,5,if you are tyrion lannister why shouldnt i kill you i make my way down to the canals i pass the fish mongers and the bakers i usually see lhara my first customer of the day on her way home then i turn left onto moonsinger lane turn left onto ragman lane where i do most of my trade lanna is very impressive very industrious she will make a fine servant for the manyfaced god to pay your family back for what it did to mine how will she serve him she will no longer turn left onto ragman lane she will turn right and go to ragman harbor what will she do there she will see see what how can a man tell a girl this if he knew what she would see there would be no reason to send her oysters clams and cockles you want revenge against the lannisters oysters clams and cockles oysters clams and cockles your oysters fresh best in the city you wouldnt lie to an old man would you mm very nice give me four with vinegar its my th voyage returned from all of them without a scratch on me cant do it i killed my mother joanna lannister please ive three children without me here take it you have to ive three children what will they do  come on theyve nothing without me please you have to please you dont understand please the man is a gambler on the day i was born he wages that a sailors ship will make it to its destination it is a strange wager for the captain he only wins if he loses his life so why would a captain make the wager in the first place a girl tells a man that she has seen if the captain dies the thin man pays his family a lot of money but perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides he does not have to pay after all i killed my father tywin lannister with a bolt to the heart a destitute woman and her small child what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself to whom can they turn for recourse the manyfaced god you said you didnt know what i would see at the docks a man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not a girl named lanna will return to the docks she will watch the gambler she will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself and then what i am the greatest lannister killer of our time a gift for the thin man shes not ready perhaps she is perhaps shes not and if shes not it is all the same to the manyfaced god the trial will take place soon the high sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you the charges fornication treason incest so i should welcome you into my service the murder of king robert all lies of course your grace my concern is that the faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown i hope youll excuse me for saying it but belief is so often the death of reason i wish you had said it sooner is there any word from jaime no im afraid not because you murdered members of your own family your grace grand maester pycelle has summoned your uncle kevan back from casterly rock to serve as hand of the king he now presides over the small council tell him i need to speak to him i implored him to visit you but he would not what about my son the king if you can visit me then surely the king your arrest and queen margaerys arrest into your service the king has not taken them well he remains in his chambers his servants often find his food in the hall left untouched you need to talk to him you need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me come and see his mother he i tried your grace he wouldnt see me he wont see anyone i cant stay here there is a way your grace may your grace we have only just met a way out confess to the high sparrow i wont i made him i rose him up from nothing i will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness goodbye my queen the work continues its too soon to know if you deserve my service why why theon im not theon there is no theon reek  reek why did you tell him reek i was helping you you wanted to escape there is no escape not ever theon greyjoy tried to escape if youd rather return to the fighting pits the master knew he knows everything he hunted him and caught him and strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no theon left good if it werent for you id still have a family if i could do what ramsay did to you right here right now i would just say the word i deserved everything i deserve to be reek i did terrible things turned on robb captured winterfell killed those boys  they werent those boys they were bran and rickon they were your brothers youve known them since they were born they werent they were only only what when i was a young man i heard a story i cant  tell me i cant not unless the master says tell me they werent what  they werent tell me why bran and rickon should be gone while you still breathe the air tell me to my face theon tell me that they werent your brothers they werent bran and rickon i couldnt find them it was two farm boys about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory i killed them and burned them so no one would know you didnt do you know where they went bran and rickon i cant talk to you anymore theon you have to tell me do you have any idea where not theon reek our scouts tell us hes got no more than  men more than half of those are mounted however and how high do stanniss horses jump our walls have been fully repaired she had no wealth no lands no army the gates have been reinforced we have enough food for six months we are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be all we have to do is wait for them to freeze starve and mutiny you disagree stannis isnt from the north you are father i think youre missing an opportunity to show the people of the north how house bolton treats southern invaders only a name and a handful of supporters and what do you recommend that we not sit and wait for stannis to decide what sort of fight this is going to be that we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows a smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage as long as we stay behind these walls they cant touch us not to mention that the snow is so deep we couldnt get an army through to engage them most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves even if we wanted to i dont need an army i need  good men so have you decided yet whether im worthy of your service have you decided yet whether youre going to have me killed its probably my safest option i can see why you would think so its what your father would have done and what would your father have done they kept her alive moving her from place to place my father who publically sentenced me to death id say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear is that why you killed him someday if you decide not to execute me ill tell you all about why i killed my father and on that day should it ever come well need more wine than this i know what my father was what he did often hours ahead of the men whod been sent to kill her i know the mad king earned his name so here we sit two terrible children of two terrible fathers im terrible ive heard stories why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible to see if you were the right kind of terrible which kind is that the kind that prevents your people from being even more so well i did reopen the fighting pits she was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world under my rule murder will once again become entertainment yes that was wise and you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good very impressive my own sister married someone she loathed as well though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good gods forbid she ended up having him killed perhaps it wont come to that its not impossible that varys was right about you after all and that appeared to be that varys king roberts spymaster yes hes the one who convinced me to come find you he was my travelling companion before ser jorah seized that role for himself jorah sent my secrets to varys for  years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me he did what he had to do to survive he did a lot of other things as well things he didnt have to do i suspect hes the main reason you werent slaughtered in your crib but you trust him and then a few years later yes oddly he may be the only person in the world i trust except my brother the brother who killed my father thats the one perhaps i will have you killed after all your queenly prerogative i had given up on life until varys convinced me you might be worth living for if you chop off my head well the most wellinformed person i knew my final days were interesting im not going to kill you no banish me no so if im not going to be murdered and im not going to be banished youre going to advise me while you can still speak in complete sentences advise you on what how to get what i want told me that this girl without wealth lands or armies the iron throne perhaps you should try wanting something else if i want jokes ill get myself a proper fool im not entirely joking theres more to the world than westeros after all how many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here perhaps this is where you belong where you can do the most good i fought so that no child born into slavers bay would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time i will continue that fight here and beyond but this is not my home when you get back to your home who supports you the common people lets be generous and assume thats going to happen here in slavers bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people what was that like ruling without the rich house targaryen is gone not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you along with three dragons the starks are gone as well our two terrible fathers saw to that the remaining members of house lannister will never back you not ever stannis baratheon wont back you either his entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours that leaves the tyrells not impossible not enough lannister targaryen baratheon stark tyrell theyre all just spokes on a wheel he thought she was our best this ones on top then that ones on top and on and on it spins crushing those on the ground its a beautiful dream stopping the wheel youre not the first person whos ever dreamt it im not going to stop the wheel im going to break the wheel you said whoever wins will fight at the great pit in front of the queen i won you struck me have me flogged if it makes you happy last chance to build a better world but im the best youve got if i win at the great pit how much can you sell me for youre a free man you could have gone anywhere why did you come back let me fight for her and i belong to you thirsty confess ua  ua i thought you were worth meeting at the very least ill get out of here you realize before long confess i can make you a wealthy woman a lady of the court confess or i can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable and all i do is sit here imagining hideous ways for you to die does it hurt no and why are you worth meeting good how are you im not the one who got punched and kicked in the face you know what i mean im good are you scared  a little me too whos there  olly oh come in why should i spend my time listening to you i heard what happened oh not to worry men brawl from time to time its only natural figured you were hungry oh youre a good lad wanted to ask you something if youve got the time i need to check on baby sam now then how can i help its about the lord commander  yes because you cannot build a better world on your own hes going up to hardhome to save all them wildlings wildlings killed my mom and dad they killed everyone in my village weve been fighting them for years this wasnt a fight we were farmers and they slaughtered us so why is he saving them wildlings are people just like us there are good ones and bad ones the one hes travelling with the one with the red beard you have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule he led the raid on my village oh olly  how can he trust him ive seen the army of the dead ive seen the white walkers and theyre coming for us for all the living and when its time well need every last man we can find but what if we let the wildlings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep jons taking a risk but he has to the strengths and weaknesses of the houses we dont stand a chance otherwise sometimes a man has to make hard choices choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run you believe that with all my heart try not to worry olly ive been worrying about jon for years he always comes back turn us about that will either join or oppose you you trust me jon snow does that make me a fool were fools together now lord of bones been a long time last time i saw you the little crow was your prisoner the other way around now what happened war war you call that a war the greatest army the north has ever seen i will have a very large army cut to pieces by some southern king we should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk you dont give the orders here im not giving an order why arent you in chains hes not my prisoner no what is he were allies and very large dragons you fucking traitor you fight for the crows now i dont fight for the crows were not here to fight were here to talk is that right you and the pretty crow do a lot of talking tormund and when youre done talking do you get down on your knees and suck his cock gather the elders and lets talk my names jon snow killing and politics arent always the same thing im lord commander of the nights watch were not friends weve never been friends we wont become friends today this isnt about friendship this is about survival this is about putting a foot wall between you and whats out there you built that wall to keep us out since when do the crows give two shits if we live when i served as hand of the king in normal times we wouldnt but these arent normal times the white walkers dont care if a mans free folk or crow were all the same to them meat for their army but together we can beat them beat the white walkers good luck with that run from them maybe its not a trick its a gift for those who join us dragonglass a man of the nights watch used one of these daggers i did quite well with the latter considering the king in question to kill a walker you saw this  no but i trust the man there are old stories about dragonglass there are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds and with the things weve seen you dont believe them come with me and ill share these weapons come with you where there are good lands south of the wall the nights watch will let you through the tunnel preferred torturing animals to leading his people and allow your people to farm those lands i knew mance rayder he never wanted a war with the nights watch he wanted a new life for his people for you were prepared to give you that new life if if you swear youll join us when the real war begins where is mance he died  how i put an arrow through his heart i could do an even better job hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey i say we send the lord commander back to castle black with no eyes hey none of you saw mance die i did the southern king who broke our army stannis wanted to burn him alive to send us a message jon snow defied that cunts orders advising a ruler worth the name his arrow was mercy what he did took courage and thats what we need today the courage to make peace with men weve been killing for generations i lost my father my uncle and two brothers fighting the damn crows im not asking you to forget your dead ill never forget mine i lost  brothers the night that mance attacked the wall if that is indeed what you are but im asking you to think about your children now theyll never have children of their own if we dont band together the long night is coming and the dead come with it no clan can stop them the free folk cant stop them the nights watch cant stop them and all the southern kings cant stop them so you want to advise me only together all of us and even then it may not be enough but at least well give the fuckers a fight you vouch for this man tormund hes prettier than both my daughters but he knows how to fight hes young but he knows how to lead he didnt have to come to hardhome he came because he needs us and we need him very well my ancestors would spit on me if i broke bread with a crow so would mine but fuck em theyre dead ill never trust a man in black but i trust you tormund if you say this is the way were with you this is the way im with tormund we stay here were dead men what would you have me do with him at least with king crow theres a chance tormund keep that new life you want to give us and keep your glass king crow as soon as you get on his ships theyre gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the shivering sea thats our enemy that has always been our enemy i fucking hate thenns move it  be careful i swore i would kill him if he ever returned  move em along now  castoff time thats it come on how many are with us im not good at counting were leaving too many behind the free folk are stubborn you

run he claims he would kill for you and die for you quickly quickly row row  go go come on lets go now now come on row and nothing i ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him and yet he did betray you did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal you will not speak yes many opportunities and did he no not until forced to do so he worships you he is in love with you i think but he did not trust you with the truth an unpleasant truth to be sure but one of great significance to you he did not trust that you would be wise >enough to forgive him how do i know you are who you say you are so i should kill him a ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion and youre going to need to inspire devotion a lot of it if youre ever going to rule across the narrow sea but you cannot have him by your side when you do remove ser jorah from the city confess my son let me speak to if only i were otherwise confess i meant it my face will be the last thing you see my name is lanna im an orphan when i was eight i begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters i sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more it took a while but i finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart now every morning ,4108

sure to send a cask of the arbors finest your way im afraid i dont partake oh  there it is some consider usury distasteful dishonorable pure nonsense of course im glad we see eye to eye on this matter did you know that at one point maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the seven kingdoms wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands most unfortunate for the glovers if a man charges no interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose open the gates so why chance it whereas the promise of reward makes a man willing to gamble we are not gamblers here at the iron bank lord tyrell you are the worlds best gamblers and all those bets you won built this we should celebrate im afraid i still have a good deal of work to do oh nonsense works

tomorrow a girl has work to do or her your rebellion is over you can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die i believe in second chances i dont believe in third chances you write like a sevenyearold your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me he didnt try to make you pay mmmmm maybe hes changed a band of  men maybe less every one of them is alive because of you and no one else the queen will be thrilled to know youre bringing her daughter home she will you love her very much dont you of course shes my niece i wasnt talking about her you think i disapprove why because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from they disapproved of oberyn and me where you are from here no one blinked an eye i dont think that facts lost on them years ago no one would have blinked an eye at you if youd been named targaryen its always changing who were supposed to love and who were not the only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want i know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man i love perhaps even you are innocent of that father you have a good heart jon snow arent you cold no what are you reading the dance of dragons  whats it about its the story of the fight between rhaenyra targaryen and her halfbrother aegon for control over the seven kingdoms both of them thought they belonged on the iron throne when people started declaring for one of them or the other their fight divided the kingdoms in two brothers fought brothers dragons fought dragons by the time it was over thousands were dead itll get us all killed and it was a disaster for the targaryens as well they never truly recovered the dance of dragons why is that a dance its just what they call it hmm doesnt make much sense i think its poetic if you had to choose between rhaenyra and aegon who would you have chosen out of my way i wouldnt have chosen either its all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible sometimes a person has to choose sometimes the world forces his hand if a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all he must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be however much he may hate it you sent for me your grace its all right father you dont even know what im talking about it doesnt matter i want to help you is there any way i can help yes there is good i want to im the princess shireen of house baratheon and im your daughter forgive me find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you wheres my father i want to see my father it will all be over soon

dont do this mother please they were in and out before anyone spotted them in return when i take the throne please mother please please no please no no where have you been just making sure everything is in order ill make sure the nights watch has all the men it requires theyre waiting for you clap your hands that one the smaller man no question thats where you should put your money the smaller man it is im not putting my money anywhere kings and queens never bet on the games perhaps you should go find someone who does people used to bet against me when i fought in the pits he can guard all  castles on the wall if he so wishes he would have bet against me common novice mistake ive spent much of my life in this arena and in my experience large men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not has your experience ever involved any actual fighting you yourself have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you whenever i got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me all skin and bone back then then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me your grace you named me your hand they couldnt get their money out fast enough but the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here and the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles werent yes whenever i saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces i knew i could rest easy you dont approve theres always been more than enough death in the world for my taste i can do without it in my leisure time yes fair enough yet its an unpleasant question but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty its easy to confuse what is with what ought to be especially when what is has worked out in your favor im not talking about myself im talking about the necessary conditions for greatness that is greatness that is a vital part of the great city of meereen which existed long before you or i and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt the kings hand should never abandon the king my father would have liked you one day your great city will return to the dirt as well at your command  if need be and how many people will die to make this happen if it comes to that they will have died for a good reason those men think theyre dying for a good reason someone elses reason so your reasons are true and theirs are false especially in time of war they dont know their own minds but you do well said youre an eloquent man doesnt mean youre wrong in my experience eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles your grace  shut your mouth you can end this  she cannot youre not abandoning me youre obeying a command you can protect your queen go your grace your grace come with me i know a way out i know a way stay close this way the other side follow me a boy with a scroll could deliver this message protect your queen drogon valahd and if jon snow refuses the boy with the scroll burnt our food stores to the ground what does the boy say i didnt name you hand for your expertise in military matters ride for castle black dont come back emptyhanded your grace perhaps queen selyse and princess shireen could accompany me my family stays with me at least let me take shireen a siege is no place for a little girl my family stays with me whats this one now all our siege weapons destroyed the dance of dragons a true telling by grand maester munkun now that sounds like a proper story ser byron swann wanted to kill the dragon vhagar he polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror and he crouched behind it and crept forward hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection but the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield and burnt him to a crisp thus ending the dragonslaying career dozens of tents were  horses of ser byron swann i made you something princess do you like it hes beautiful thank you  youre very welcome will you make me a doe too so that he can have company of course i will but why am i getting a present because you deserve it my son was always on me trying to teach me to read were still getting a count but hundreds are dead gods i was stubborn about it made it this far without reading seemed to me i could make it to the grave wish id listened to him this is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grownup ill be gone for a few days princess i want to hear all about the dance of dragons when im back youll read it yourself prince doran men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm forgive us we started without you please sit princess myrcella uncle what a lovely dress you dont like it  you must be cold not at all the dornish climate agrees with me prince trystane hows

she sees youre happy im sure she will you really believe that have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children she likes you im not so sure about that listen theres something i wanted to tell you speak up cant be worse than mutiny something i should have told you long ago so now that youve seen more of the world youve learned how complicated things can be people can be the lannisters and the martells have hated each other for years but youve fallen in love with trystane it was an accident really i mean what were the chances you happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry cut her down my point is we dont choose whom we love it just well its beyond our control i sound like an idiot  no you dont what im trying to say what im trying and failing to say i know what youre trying to say no im afraid you dont i do your grace i know about you and mother i think a part of me always knew and im glad im glad that youre my father myrcella myrcella

exiled from city get the men into marching formation our queen would be dead if not for him puufila thank you i am sorry sorry i not there to fight for our queen you missed a good scrap none of that matters now the longer we sit here bantering the longer daenerys is out there in the wilderness hes right the dragon headed north if were going to find her thats where well have to go on to winterfell we youre a lannister the queen intends to remove your family from power and i intend to help her do it youve been here for how many days now ive fought for her for years since she was little more than a child you betrayed her  careful now and she exiled you twice i believe the second time thanks to you he raised his hands dont blame me for your crimes mormont hes right our queen exiled jorah and hes right jorah saved her life perhaps she feels differently about him now perhaps not the only way well know is if we ask her fine fine i suppose he can join us just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep if i ever kill you your eyes will be wide open forgive me but why would we bring you pardon me and they all stood up at once have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness not precisely but i have other skills that would be useful can you fight i have fought i dont claim to be a great warrior are you good on a horse middling so mainly you talk and drink ive survived so far which i respect but you would not help us on this expedition tens of thousands of them the biggest army in the world you would help us here in meereen though none of us have experience governing a city except for him you want to prove your value to the queen prove it right here in meereen hes a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language why would the meereenese listen to him they wouldnt they will listen to grey worm ill come with you so what are you gonna do ill find our queen you are not strong enough to go anywhere  i am he is hes the toughest man with no balls i ever met but you still cant go the people believe in you they know you speak for the queen its true only the unsullied can keep the peace in meereen if you leave half this city will consume the other half and missandei im gonna hope they dont learn how to climb the wall our queen trusts no one more than missandei certainly not me the queens closest confidante the commander of the unsullied and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face good fortune my friends meereen is ancient and glorious try not to ruin her looks like its you and me jorah the andal lets find some good horses but the dragonglass we have so much to talk about hello old friend i thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me i suppose theres no point asking how you found me the birds sing in the west the birds sing in the east if one knows how to listen they tell me youve already found favor with the mother of dragons well she didnt execute me so thats a promising start no ones ever getting that back now now the heroes are off to find her and im stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war any advice for an old comrade information is the key you need to learn your enemys strengths and strategies you need to learn which of your friends are not your friends if only i knew someone with a vast network of spies if only a grand old city it wouldnt have mattered anyway choking on violence corruption and deceit who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive ungainly beast i did miss you oh i know we have to go home oh my poor sweet thing does it hurt we have to go home drogon not unless we had a mountain of it can you take me back to meereen how far did you carry me drogon we need to return my people need me well theres no food at the very least you could hunt us some supper

bonds of marriage i confess with longclaw name him lancel lannister your cousin and the kings squire i was lonely and afraid  you had a husband a husband off whoring every chance he his sins do not pardon your own may the gods forgive me other men no no others i saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass no speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime you understand this i do there are those that say your children were not fathered by king robert that they are bastards born of incest and adultery a lie a lie from the lips of stannis baratheon he wants the throne but his brothers  children stand in his way but longclaw   is valyrian steel so he claims they are not his brothers that filth there is not one shred of truth to it i deny it good but these are terrible charges and the realm must know the truth of them if your grace has given honest testimony your trial will prove your innocence trial i have confessed how many valyrian steel swords are left in the seven kingdoms to a single sin others you have denied your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods i bow to the wisdom of your high holiness but if i might beg for just one drop of the mothers mercy i havent seen my son i dont know how long its been i need to see him please you have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness not enough in light of this i will permit you to return to the red keep thank you thank you the mother is merciful it is her you should thank i will i will i swear it day and night good am i free to go the first lord commander in history after your atonement my

the flames mother all i could think about when she died was what would happen to her now every day every night what does mama look like now has she started to bloat has her skin turned black have her lips peeled back from her teeth i think about locking myrcella in a crypt i think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse but hes gone shh shh dont think about it i have to i have to its not right she has to suffer alone shes not suffering shes gone no one can hurt her anymore she was good from her first breath she was so sweet i dont know where she came from she was nothing like me no meanness no jealousy just good he was our lord commander i know i thought if i could make something so good so pure maybe im not a monster  listen listen to me she was my daughter and i failed her no i knew this would happen the witch told me years ago she promised me three children and she promised me theyd die and gold their shrouds everything she said came true he never should have been you couldnt have stopped it its prophecy its fate you dont believe that  of course i do you told me yourself when father died you said we had to stay together you said people would try to tear us apart take whats ours that was a prophecy too i didnt listen to you and everything you said came true fuck prophecy fuck fate fuck everyone who isnt us you all know why youre here were the only ones who matter the only ones in this world and everything theyve taken from us were going to take back and more were going to take everything there is the seven hells brim with the souls of saintly men they scream in agony and their shame is so great they do not feel the flames for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed they were saved jon snow is dead id like to see my brother confess  please how is he at least tell me that confess i am the queen and i demand to see my brother sinners dont make demands they make confessions septa unella our other guests need you there who killed him septa unella can be overzealous at times ill speak with her my brother can you tell me how he is it isnt ser loras that brings me here your husband misses you dearly the love between a man and wife is sacred it reflects the love the gods have for all of us but sin leads us away from the sacred and only confession can purge sin i have nothing to confess i did so you believe you are pure perfect wholly without sin none of us are you have started down the path but you have many miles to go i always envied oberyn he lived he truly lived sailed around the world and bowen marsh and othell yarwyck fought men from every country lay with the most beautiful women alive and men  and men he experienced everything while i sat here in dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed but that is life we each have our roles oberyn was born to be an adventurer and i was born to rule and the other officers in this castle the gods are not fools you would have been a lousy adventurer and oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler your mother is a brilliant woman you know that prince doran the princess myrcella when was the last time you left this palace you dont know your own people their disgust for you murderers  traitors elia martell raped and murdered and you did nothing oberyn martell butchered and you did nothing youre not a dornishman youre not our prince my son trystane your son is weak just like you and weak men will never rule dorne again i told you im not hungry were not here to feed you were here to kill you youre right you want her to do it or me we are family i dont want to hurt you her or me you good smart boy youre a greedy bitch you know that were never going to fix whats wrong with this city from the top of an foot pyramid well be fine weve committed treason all of us were dressed like common merchants you walk like a rich person youve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk you walk as though the paving stones were your personal property i used to steal from people like you when i was a boy its a good thing youre not a boy anymore because you have no cock she thinks you want to eat her baby mhysa means mother in valyrian  i know what mhysa means who wrote it  hard to know jon snow was my lord commander our queen is not as popular in meereen as she used to be the sons of the harpy very possibly daenerys targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings werent even property to begin with you can see why theyre unhappy of course it could also be the freed men many of the former slaves feel that daenerys has abandoned them she did fly away on a dragon and not come back i had no love for him its a problem fear has brought meereen to a standstill whoever you are wherever you go someone in this city wants to murder you we cant fight an enemy we dont know the sons of the harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully which means they take orders from someone and have you started looking for that someone my little birds have already taken wing that was no secret soon theyll return singing songs of men in gold masks well we wont be sailing to westeros anytime soon goat ram you think our friend got him dont know anything else that can melt a rams horn were on the right path then perhaps shes tired of being queen i dont think she likes it very much shes too smart to like it but i never once disobeyed an order maybe shes flown somewhere else somewhere far away from men like us ive been all over the world theres no escaping men like us theres no escaping her eh you keep coming back why you know why isnt it frustrating wanting someone who doesnt want you back of course it is loyalty is the foundation youre a romantic i admire that sometimes i look at you and i think so thats what ill be like when i grow old if you grow old if i grow old i hope i do i want to see what the world looks like when shes done conquering it so do i huh an army on which the nights watch is built not an army a horde dothraki they have her no but there has to be a price to pay for everything i know but have you tried telling him that thank you whod go there after what happened to that kingsguard  probably had it coming  maybe so and the watch means everything to me but im not risking it  just cant do it  all right honesty as well he gets it are you listening blind girl do you hear them talking do any of them talk to you no so sad stand and fight blind girl i cant see i have given my life thats your problem not mine see you tomorrow ser davos we have no cause to fight we are both anointed knights hear that lads nothing to fear i will grant amnesty to all brothers who throw down their arms before nightfall and you ser davos i will allow you to travel south a free man with a fresh horse and some mutton we have all given our lives to the nights watch id like some mutton what  im not much of a hunter ill need some food if im gonna make it south without starving well give you food you can bring the red woman with you if you like or you can leave her here with us whichever you choose but surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood thank you ser alliser well discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer boys ive been running from men like that all my life jon snow was going to destroy the nights watch in my learned opinion we open that door and theyll slaughter us all they want to come in theyre gonna come in aye but we dont need to make it easy for them edd is our only chance its a sad fucking statement if dolorous edd is our only chance theres always the red woman whats one redhead gonna do against  armed men you havent seen her do what ive seen her do he let the wildlings through our gates its coming from the courtyard as no lord commander has ever done before he gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered lord commander snow did what he thought was right ive no doubt about that and what he thought was right would have been the end of us he thrust a terrible choice upon us and we made it hell have seen we didnt come thorne will have made it official by now its the lord commander castle black is his i dont care whos sitting at the high table jon was my friend and those fuckers butchered him now we return the favor we dont have the numbers we have a direwolf  its not enough i didnt know lord

man still a great victory trust do you feel like a victor i rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to sansa stark do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired

52,3,8.8,6,fidel may afterwards after they stabbed you meeras father ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw lord stark i looked for you on the trident we werent there your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been the mad king is dead after you died where did you go rhaegar lies beneath the ground why werent you there to protect your prince our prince wanted us here wheres my sister i wish you good fortune in the wars to come and now it begins no now it ends hes better than my father far better what did you see but father beat him did he i know he did heard the story a thousand times he stabbed him in the back whats in the tower thats enough for one day well visit again another time i want to see where hes going  time to go father nothing why did you do that take me back there i want to go back no he heard me  maybe maybe he heard the wind  he heard me the past is already written the ink is dry whats in that tower i want to go back there ive told you many times stay too long where you dont belong and you will never return there was nothing at all why do i want to return so i can be a cripple again so i can talk to an old man in a tree you think i wanted to sit here for  years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me so why did you i was waiting for you i dont want to be you i dont blame you the lord let you come back for a reason you wont be here forever you wont be an old man in a tree but before you leave you must learn learn what everything stannis was not the prince who was promised but someone has to be could you give us a moment i dont know how you stand it in all that leather you were dead if we could have the room you look lovely today my dear you really do how you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat if youre going to torture me just call them back and get on with it i am not a torturer though it so often is what people deserve and it does provide answers but theyre usually the wrong answers my job is to find the right answers easy easy and now youre not do you know how i do that i do it by making people happy id like to make you happy vala thats your name isnt it vala thats all right i know who you are and what youve done youve done a lot youve sacrificed your body for a cause which is more than most people do and youve helped the sons of the harpy thats completely fucking mad seems to me murder the unsullied and the second sons the unsullied and the second sons are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history i understand well that makes perfect sense from your perspective i have a different perspective of course i think its important that you try to see things from my perspective just as i will try to see them from yours i can only imagine how it seems to you because that is the only way that i can make you and dom happy that is how you pronounce it dom im afraid i dont really speak the language such a handsome boy those big brown eyes good luck keeping the ladies away yes youre a true liberator arent you you wont torture me youll just threaten my son children are blameless i have never hurt them i did what i thought was right your boy is in no immediate danger this i swear to you but between us dear you did conspire to kill the queens soldiers we both know the penalty for that crime how will poor dom get on without his mother and with his breathing problem if i tell you anything theyll kill me so either you kill me or they do yes from your perspective this is a problem and i got murdered for it there is a third option though a ship leaving tomorrow for pentos ive already booked passage for a woman and her young son ill even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again though im afraid well have to ask one of our leatherclad friends back in to carry it far too heavy for me the boat sails at dawn you need to decide now a new life for you and dom and now im back or what should we do while we wait to pass the time what should we do what should we talk about you speak  languages you must occasionally use some of them to talk about things you two you spend a great deal of time together what would you be talking about if i werent here patrol when i am going on patrol with the unsullied why what we see on patrol who we captured on patrol thats good thats very good but thats a report i was thinking more of a conversation a wise man once said the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms who said this me just now i dont know all right no conversations lets play a game you dont play games either one of you ever games are for children my master kraznys would sometimes make us play games there thats a start only the girls  no no no not that of course not that innocent games fun games maybe well never know drinking games we do not drink until you do all right no drinking we can play without drinking its a wonderful game i invented it heres how it works i make a statement about your past if im wrong i drink and if im right what does it matter maybe we cant play without drinking oh you took your time sorry i was busy learning who funds the sons of the harpy some things you cant rush  you found out the good masters of astapor and the wise masters of yunkai with help from their friends in volantis you see you dont even have to worry about the local rebellion easy you go on we only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it we conquered astapor and yunkai once we will do it again and execute the masters if the unsullied march off to reconquer astapor and yunkai who will remain to defend the free people of meereen if we do not fight them how can we stop them we cannot the masters speak only one language they spoke it to me for many years you fight for as long as you can i know it better than my mother tongue if we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them may it be the last thing they ever hear you may be right so we will fight them possibly  possibly its a conversation tell me can your little birds get a message to the good masters of astapor the wise masters of yunkai and benevolent enslavers of volantis you clean up as much of the shit as you can of course men can be fickle but birds i always trust your eye looks much better arthur hows your mothers jaw better and your father no ones seen him and no one will that worked out rather nicely will lord varys ever come back i dont know how to do that i dont think so do you miss him he was nice he called us his little birds he gave us sweets its funny you should mention that guess what i happened to find today candied plums from dorne now remember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me i thought i did but all i need in return are whispers no need to be afraid this is ser gregor hes friends with all my friends run along now varyss little birds your little birds now your grace what did you do to him exactly i havent been able to get a clear answer oh a number of things i failed does he understand what were saying i mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place he understands well enough so tell him to march into the sept and crush the high sparrows head like a melon the high sparrow has hundreds of faith militant surrounding him ser gregor cant face them all and he wont have to hell only have to face one good has the faith leveled official charges yet not yet that is one trial by combat i look forward to watching dont stop at the city i want little birds in dorne in highgarden in the north if someone is planning on making our losses their gains i want to hear it if someone is laughing at the queen who walked naked through the streets covered in shit now go fail again i want to hear i want to know who they are i want to know where they are as bad as lord varys was qyburn is worse i told them all i told them hes arrogant dangerous you dont get thrown out of the citadel without good reason and no one listened to my advice so here we are and what hes done to gregor clegane they think youre some kind of god is an abomination we never sanctioned this experiment i for one think it will be in our best interest to have the beast dest can i help you  why are you here my mother  i was invited my dear to help deal with several troublesome issues such as the queens imprisonment thank you for bringing it up its well past time we addressed the abuses i endured the man who returned from the dead margaery is the queen you are not the queen because youre not married to the king i do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family this is a small council meeting you have no position on the small council im the lord commander of the kingsguard the lord commander of the kingsguard does have a position on the small council what do you remember im not a god grand maester pycelle would you sanction that statement well um i would say ser gerold hightower had a seat on the mad kings council of course that was the mad king king robert saw things differently and king what about myrcellas death uncle do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue i know that the same women who murdered myrcella have overthrown house martell and taken control of dorne weve got a lot to discuss all of us together and seeing as you cannot make us leave we best get on with it no we cannot make you leave and you cannot make us stay not unless youre gonna have that thing murder us all your grace my mother would like to see her daughters final resting place i saw your pecker im sorry your grace thats not possible not yet when will it be possible when shes fully atoned for her sins you cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city that wasnt the full atonement no she must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extent of her sins what kind of god would have a pecker that small i want you to let her see myrcellas resting place i am the king you are and what does that mean to you it means a great deal to me the crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world do you know who told me that your mother my mother who is unclean your eyes are still brown my mother who still needs to atone after all youve put her through how do you think the mother above first came to us how did men and women first come to feel the mothers presence hmm it was through their own mothers theres a great deal of falsehood in cersei you know that but when she speaks of you the mothers love outshines it all her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesnt come from this world is that still you in there but you know that youve felt it youve seen her when she talks to you yes its a great gift one i never had envy one more thing for me to atone for your grace do you may i do you mind i think so its my knees of course when your mother made her walk of atonement she did it to get back to you i still dont understand why you want to put her through any more than shes already endured its not what i want its what the gods want they make their will known to us and its up to us to either accept or reject it please hold off on burning my body for now if were to be just and good then we accept it all of us even kings a true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can and no one is wiser than the gods my grandfather once said something similar except for the part about the gods the gods worked through him whether he knew it or not as they work through your mother theres so much good in all of us the best we can do is to help each other bring it out thats funny who are you no one who were you before you came here arya stark tell me about arya starks family her father was eddard stark her mother was catelyn stark she had one sister sansa and four brothers three brothers you sure thats still you in there robb bran rickon and a halfbrother jon and where are they now they may be dead for all a girl knows tell me about the hound also dead arya stark left him to die he was on her list he was not on her list anymore she had taken him off it why didnt she want him dead any longer they stabbed me you all right she did and she did not she sounds confused yes she was who else was on arya starks funny little list cersei lannister gregor clegane walder frey thats a short list that cant be everyone you want to kill are you sure youre not forgetting someone yes yes im fine which name would you like a girl to speak if a girl tells me her name i will give her eyes back a girl has no name come if a girl is truly no one she has nothing to fear who are you no one the umbers are a famously loyal house did i ever tell you i used to think the sea was called the see famously loyal to the starks and you lord karstark your people share blood with the starks dont they but here we are times change when my father became warden of the north your house refused to pledge their banners your father was a cunt my beloved father the warden your father was a cunt and thats why you killed him i might have done the same to my father because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see if he hadnt have done me the favor of dying on his own my father was poisoned by our enemies mmm why have you come to winterfell lord umber the bastard jon snow led an army of wildlings past the wall were farther north than any of you fuckers wildlings come down we always have to fight them first i like fighting wildlings been doing it all my life but there are too many of them for us to beat back alone so now youve come seeking help i dont think so we need to help each other the colder it gets the farther south those goat fuckers will roam wont take them long to get here you think a horde of wildlings can take winterfell if they get jon snow leading them maybe he knows this place better than we ever will pledge your banners to house bolton swear loyalty to me as warden of the north and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends sea see im not kissing your fucking hand traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord im not doing that either why would i trust a man who wont honor tradition your father honored tradition knelt for robb stark called him king of the north was robb stark right to trust your father then it appears were at a bit of an impasse fuck kneeling and fuck oaths theyre spelled different but they sound the same ive got a gift for you a girl i hope i prefer redheads a girl aye a wild one i like them wild and the boy nice and young the way karstark likes them whos this rickon stark how do i know thats rickon stark yeah they do welcome home lord stark its time if you have any last words now is the time you shouldnt be alive its not right neither was killing me my mothers still living at white harbor could you write her tell her i died fighting the wildlings i had a choice lord commander it was before i learned how to read obviously betray you or betray the nights watch you brought an army of wildlings into our lands an army of murderers and raiders if i had to do it all over knowing where id end up i pray id make the right choice again im sure you would ser alliser i fought i lost now i rest but you lord snow youll be fighting their battles forever sam are you going to be sick we should burn the bodies you should what do you want me to do with this wear it burn it whatever you want you have castle black my watch is ended fidel may olly wont be long well be in the south soon im excited to see oldtown captain says its the most beautiful city in westeros are you going to vomit again no no no no the citadel doesnt admit women there wont be a place for you there or for little sam i stayed at castle black theres no women allowed there the citadel isnt castle black i dont

53,4,9.2,6,may how can you leave us now you told me you were taking sansa stark home with you to the fingers indeed i was and yet not long ago we received reports that she has been married to ramsay bolton in winterfell on our way to the fingers we were set upon by a large force of bolton men seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting do you take me for a fool tell me lord royce i did everything i could you know that how many people knew of my travel plans with sansa stark i shared my intentions with you and no one else slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him your home is the vale the lord of the vale stands before us and only his judgment concerns me shall we throw him through the moon door my lord my lord i have always been faithful to house arryn you swore a vow to your father to your mother and now to you do you believe him uncle petyr lord royce has served the vale well hes enjoyed a distinguished military career if we could trust his absolute loyalty he would make a capable commander in the wars to come you can trust my absolute loyalty my lord i think he deserves one more chance what do you say fine i bring good news aye i pledged my life to the nights watch my friends in the north tell me sansa has escaped winterfell i expect shes headed to castle black where her brother serves as lord commander but she wont be safe there not with the boltons after her shes my cousin we should help her that was my instinct as well our lord has spoken gather the knights of the vale the time has come to join the fray i gave my life  for all nights to come you invite the enemy into our city i did as a clever man once told me we make peace with our enemies not our friends i dont make peace with the queens enemies i kill the queens enemies yes thats the military approach and how has that worked here in meereen i represent the diplomatic approach our queen tried to make peace with the masters they killed me edd my own brothers and they tried to murder her we enter these negotiations with open eyes trust me my own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution how many days were you a slave long enough to know not long enough to understand i bought this dwarf for a single gold honor and somehow youve risen to the top of the great pyramid of meereen you want me to stay here after that its most impressive and now you speak for the good masters of astapor heres to reversals of fortune we came here to meet the queen and instead were greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch lets make this simple shall we tell me what you want we want you to leave slavers bay take your dragons and your mercenaries and go queen daenerys wont stay in meereen forever her path takes her westward riders approaching when we last met i offered her ships so she could return to westeros where she belongs she refused them she refused them because hundreds of thousands of men women and children still lived in chains as they have since the dawn of time not anymore  you think youre a free man now you still follow orders just because your master has silver hair and tits doesnt mean shes not a master friends friends friends please open the gate there have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing that is the way of the world im not here to change the way of the world slavery is the way of our world you dont need slaves to make money there havent been slaves in westeros for hundreds of years and i grew up richer than any of you but our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery this is good soup without providing a new system to replace it so here is the queens proposal slavery will never return to meereen but she will give the other cities of slavers bay time to adjust to the new order what does that mean instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course at fair prices do you remember those kidney pies old nan used to make in exchange you will cut off your support for the sons of the harpy we do not support the sons of the harpy fine fine but you will cut it off all the same i do hope you accept my friends you will not receive a better offer let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it and as a parting gift to our honored guests give freedom a chance with the peas and onions  mmm see if it doesnt taste every bit as good as what came before perhaps i should translate for you we speak the common tongue excellent  you met with the slavers today i did our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them i imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled but i am not your ruler we never should have left winterfell im not the breaker of chains im not the unburnt and i am certainly not the mother of dragons you are a stranger here so why do you represent meereen in these talks with our enemies because our queen chose me as her advisor until she returns from her travels when does she return soon you have my word we dont know you we dont trust you we know torgo nudho dont you wish we could go back to the day we left we fight with him against the masters we trust him and that is exactly why grey worm took part in these negotiations as commander of the unsullied he knows how to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace you have made peace with the slavers we offered terms do not use me for your lies  those men respect you they respect me because they know who i am they know i am loyal  as do i i am loyal to my queen not you i want to scream at myself dont go you idiot if you betray her work you are my enemy i am not betraying her work i am trying to save her city you promised the slavers they could keep slavery for a short time seven years is not a short time for a slave youre right slavery is a horror that should be ended at once war is a horror that should be ended at once i cant do both today you are wrong to trust these men how could we know i dont trust the masters i trust their selfinterest theyre trustworthy if theyre convinced that working with me is in their selfinterest you dont know them you dont understand them we are not human in their eyes they look at me and see a weapon they look at her and see a whore they look at me and they see a misshapen little beast their contempt is their weakness theyll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage i spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass i was to you you will not use them they will use you that is what they do you all right why dont you sit and catch your breath im fine i dont think you could ride the dragon years ago maybe what  our queen shes wild you know dont let her size fool you its hard enough for me and im a young man i wish i could change everything you i dont think your heart could take it must make you angry that our queen chose me makes me sad youll disappoint her before long shell move on  well all disappoint her before long we need each other right now after were done needing each other oh i dont want to fight you jorah the andal what do i have to gain if i win im the shit who killed an old man if i lose im the shit who was killed by an old man you didnt get much discipline as a child did you we were children none the road running through the horse gate they call that the godsway eastern market western market when khal drogo died she was supposed to come here and join the dosh khaleen the widows of the dead khals thats where they would have taken her the temple of the dosh khaleen what are you doing i was awful just admit it its forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city isnt it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi if they spot us and were unarmed well say were traders heading for the western market but if they see weapons youre asking a dog to hand over his teeth theres  of them down there we cant fight our way out we wait till dark and then well find her uh where you gonna go you were occasionally awful im very attached to this knife dont worry it didnt touch you you know what happens i know what happens ill do it myself i should have been born a dothraki come on told you im very attached to this knife you all right if they find a body with a stab wound im sure i cant have been great fun the whole city will be looking for us huh mmhmm no dont hurt her  shell give us away we have to go now we will never get out of vaes dothrak alive all we can do is try no we can do more than that and youre going to help me always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played if i were to let you leave right now where would you go  what would you seek out id go to my brother my husband my family of course but for you that means seeking out money finery power seeking out your family means seeking out sin im not maligning you i sought those things out too to the exclusion of all else can you forgive me  theres nothing to forgive my father was a cobbler he died when i was young and i took over his shop he was a simple man and he made simple shoes but i found that the more work i put into my shoes the more people wanted them fine leather ornamentation detailing and time time most of all dozens of hours spent on a single pair quality takes time forgive me  all right yes i imagine youve worn a year of someones life on your back the highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege i used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself each time i indulged i felt myself ascending to something better and one day you walked through a graveyard all right i forgive you and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness book of the stranger verse you know the sevenpointed star septa unella reads it to me at me yes yes she does enjoy reading at people youre close but it wasnt a graveyard it was a feast i bought old fine wine youd think after thousands of years and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come and share it all we passed around the wine passed around the women and soon we fell into a stupor i woke before dawn i could barely stand everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor lying in heaps next to their fine clothes the truth of their bodies laid bare i could smell them the nights watch would have learned how to make a good ale beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn and i saw it with perfect clarity i saw what my sins were the gold i had the wine i drank the women i used my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position it was all part of a story a story i was telling myself about who i was a collection of lies that would disappear in the light where will you go the people i was trying to climb away from the beggars in the street the poor they were closer to the truth than i ever was so what did you do i left to go and find them i didnt even put on my shoes i walked out the door and never went back come lets go and see him who  your brother where will we go loras loras listen to me you need to stay strong i cant stay strong i never was strong you are strong you are the future of our house the future of our family i dont care about that  shh south if i dont watch over you shh have you have you told them that that you dont care i just want it to stop help me they want me to help you they want me to help tear you down they want me to help tear you down thats why hes letting me see you i know it is and if either of us give in to what they want then they win fathers ghost will come back and murder me let them win just make it stop please all right and now how to avert disaster with our current predicament this high sparrow i have dealt with fanatics of every description your grace not setting them off thats the most important thing you are beset with enemies both within and without what are you doing here where will we go i am advising the king on our current predicament leave i am a member of the small council the king is this a small council meeting obviously not im here to lend my wisdom and my support thank you for your counsel grand maester that will be all for now your grace i cant stay here not after what happened since ive missed the past several small council meetings i wanted to speak to you about a few things ive been thinking about the high sparrow as have we all unfortunately we need to be careful in dealing with such a man to prevent things from escalating any further we have to be careful not to antagonize him he has margaery we cant put her at risk hes dangerous  look at me what did they do to me theres only one place we can go to the kings own mother its all right its done its in the past and of course margaerys safety is paramount you dont like margaery do you whether i like her or not is completely unimportant margaery is the queen queens must command respect kings even more so not just for their own sake but for everyones home the high sparrow has no respect for kings or queens no respect for anything in this world he has no use for the things of this world he wants to knock them down and replace them with what with fantasies with beggars in the street with nothing mother theres something i want to tell you something the high sparrow told me should we tell the boltons to pack up and leave youve spoken with him i promised him i wouldnt tell anyone if he found out i told it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth i am your mother you can always trust me the small council meeting has been postponed on the kings orders i would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time youre not welcome you once spoke of your respect for our father well take it back from them because he understood the necessity of working with ones rivals my dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority publically shamed and confined to the red keep whats left to work with cersei is the mother of the king she has the kings ear and his trust and the king has been speaking regularly with the high sparrow about queen margaery and ser loras the high sparrow seized power knowing full well wed bicker amongst ourselves i dont have an army instead of seizing it back here we are well done to us now the future of the seven kingdoms rests in his dirty peasant hands in a few days hell have a trial for me but before that queen margaery will make her walk of atonement yes margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city oh no that cannot happen how many wildlings did you save that will not happen i agree youve got the second largest army in westeros youll bring them into the city stop queen margaerys humiliation before it starts and take her back into crown custody the king has ordered me to take no action against the high sparrow or the faith militant out of fear for the queens safety you will take no action at all when the tyrell armies come you will stand down what are you gonna do they didnt come here to serve me are you expressly forbidden from standing down no but if the king should call the whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything when the high sparrow is in custody or dead preferably and margaerys back at tommens side do you think the king will be angry at the outcome you hate these fanatics as much as we do you hate what theyve done to your son do you want lancel back or have you given him up for good they owe you their lives of course i want him back then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed if it doesnt go as planned the sparrows have many friends in this city well have civil war many will die many will die no matter what we do better them than us they told me you were home and i didnt believe it theon greyjoy i said you think theyll be safe here if roose bolton remains warden of the north hes dead hes been dead a long time he let you go i escaped i cant hear you i escaped look at me look at me men died trying to rescue you good men sansa  winterfell is our home my men im sorry you were my brother you were a spoiled little cunt but you were my brother and i risked everything for you and you betrayed me i know i know and im sorry stop saying that he broke me he broke me into  pieces its ours and aryas and brans and rickons i know  you dont know he sent us one of those pieces thats why i came for you why did you come here where else could i go you heard father was dead and you thought youd claim the crown no no i only heard he died after we docked you happen to show up on pyke right before the kingsmoot i didnt know you think any ironborn wants you to be king wherever they are it belongs to our family

give it a bath first youre a good talker i like that ive killed brothers of the nights watch youre a much better talker than theon greyjoy that so i had to work hard to get him talking but he talked they all do he told me everything all about the stark boys who helped them escape and how she did it open the gate get warm ive killed wildlings ive killed men that i admire sorry about the food its

leader who makes a claim i am yara greyjoy daughter of balon greyjoy king of the iron islands i claim the salt throne weve never had a queen not once but the rest of me there are many things weve never done weve never made our mark upon the world the great lords of westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance then they swat us down they conquer us humiliate us and go right back to forgetting we exist aye we are a sea people  aye he did what he liked with the rest of me our god is a sea god  aye when i am queen we will build a fleet that you shall not be queen  i am not finished yes you are a woman will not lead us not when balons own male heir has returned i am theon greyjoy last living son of balon greyjoy and she is your rightful ruler aye those of you that have sailed under her as long as i could still give him an heir and there are many of you here you know what she is  aye she is a reaver  aye she is a warrior  aye she is ironborn aye we will find no better leader this is our queen yara yara yara im euron greyjoy what do you think he did i claim the salt throne niece nephew little theon heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground captured a castle you couldnt keep got yourself taken prisoner even heard you have no cock explains why you think a woman can be king when did you return uncle i cant begin to contemplate a few days ago i had some things to take care of long overdue im glad youre here now i know what my first act as queen will be to execute the man who killed my father i did i killed him threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall what do you think he did to me he was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it werent for me no one loved him no one wanted to follow him he led us into two wars we couldnt win i apologize to you all for not killing him years ago that would have been hard to do you werent here last i heard you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time gallivanting that the sort of thing you start to say lady sansa asked you a question once your dick gets chopped off did the great lords of westeros teach you words like that you were gone yara was here being ironborn leading ironborn getting ready to bring us back to glory and how will she do that i will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen right idea except im the one whos going to build the iron fleet because im the one who knows how to use it he beat you ive been all over the world ive seen more of it than all of you combined and across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of westeros just as much as we do someone with a large army three large dragons and no husband im going to build that fleet and im going to gallivant right over and give it to daenerys targaryen along with my big cock yes yes he enjoyed that youre going to seduce the dragon queen im not going to seduce her the iron fleet will seduce her and together were going to take the seven kingdoms i wasnt born to be king i paid the iron price and here i stand euron euron euron euron euron euron euron euron euron euron may euron your servant be born again what else do you think he did from the sea as you were bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel listen to the waves listen to the god he is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but euron greyjoy let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away let the old euron drown let his lungs fill with seawater let the fish eat the scales off his eyes sansa i  what else what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger what is dead may never die what is dead may never die where are my niece and nephew lets go murder them they stole our best ships wont be enough to save them go back to your homes chop down every tree you can find did he cut you quartersaw the timber and start building i want every man bending planks i want every woman spinning flax for sails build me a thousand ships and i will give you this world i banished you twice you came back twice and you saved my life so i cant take you back and i cant send you away maybe you did know about ramsay all along you must send me away is there a cure i dont know how long does it take i dont know that either but ive seen what happens when it goes far enough ill end things before that im sorry im so sorry dont be i didnt know all ive ever wanted was to serve you tyrion lannister was right i love you ill always love you goodbye khaleesi do not walk away from your queen jorah the andal you have not been dismissed you pledged yourself to me you swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life i thought you knew everyones secrets well i command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world i command you to heal yourself and then return to me when i take the seven kingdoms i need you by my side in the last fortnight since our pact with the masters how many killings have been carried out by the sons of the harpy none and how many masters have been butchered by the free men i made a mistake a horrible mistake two but that was the day of the pact since then nothing so its safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold for now for now is the best we get in our profession its not enough considering the city was on the brink of civil war id say its a good start its not enough for meereen to have peace they need to know daenerys is responsible for it i underestimated a stranger the sons of the harpy have a good story resist the foreign invaders our queen has an even better story mother of dragons breaker of chains and all that the people know who brought them freedom yes but do they know who brought them security who brought about an end to the violence we need someone the people trust someone they know cannot be bought or influenced sounds like quite the hero where would we find him the other things he did who said anything about him thats about the extent of my valyrian thank you for travelling all this way i know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be the truth is we need your help we had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to you dont need to persuade me i came to help daenerys stormborn is the one who was promised from the fire she was reborn to remake the world for you my lady ladies arent supposed to talk about those things yes she has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the masters for their sins she did indeed her dragons are fire made flesh a gift from the lord of light but you heard all of this before havent you on the long bridge of volantis the dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands burning their sins and flesh away but i imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time ideally wed avoid purifying too many nonbelievers the mother of dragons has followers of many different faiths you want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed and while shes gone you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed id settle for obeyed i will summon my most eloquent priests they will spread the word daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come i can still feel it that sounds most excellent a man named stannis baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses he too had a glorious destiny he attacked kings landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me last i had heard he had been defeated again this time at winterfell and this time for good wed be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen i suppose its hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake i dont mean in my tender heart it still pains me so isnt that the whole point of being a fanatic youre always right everything is the lords will everything is the lords will but men and women make mistakes even honest servants of the lord and you an honest servant of the lord why should i trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled stannis my friend has a healthy skepticism of religion i can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now but we are all loyal supporters of the queen everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason terrible things happen for a reason take what happened to you lord varys when you were a child if not for your mutilation at the hand of a secondrate sorcerer you wouldnt be here helping the lords chosen bring his light into the world knowledge has made you powerful im so sorry but theres still so much you dont know do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire you heard a voice call out from the flames do you remember should i tell you what the voice said should i tell you the name of the one who spoke we serve the same queen if you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me you said you would protect me what he saw me the night king he saw me  he touched you i dont know he was close but he touched you he knows you are here hell come for you but he cant get in he can now his mark is on you you must leave all of you come on hodor help me with the sledge and i will hodor im sorry i didnt mean to the time has come  the time for what for you to become me but am i ready no we cant defend the north from the walkers and the south from the boltons if we want to survive we need winterfell and to take winterfell we need more men you must believe me when i tell you that i will aside from the starks and the boltons the most powerful houses in the north are the umbers the karstarks and the manderlys the umbers and the karstarks have already declared for the boltons so were not doing so well there the umbers gave rickon to our enemies they can hang but the karstarks declared for ramsay without knowing they had another choice i dont believe you anymore i dont need you anymore i beg your pardon my lady but they know that a stark beheaded their father i dont think we can count on them either how well do you know the north ser davos precious little my lady my father always said northerners are different more loyal more suspicious of outsiders they may well be loyal but how many rose up against the boltons when they betrayed your family how far is moles town you cant protect me i may not know the north but i know men theyre more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them dont want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause if jons going to convince them to fight alongside him they need to believe its a fight they can win there are more than three other houses in the north glover mormont cerwyn mazin hornwood two dozen more together they equal all the others you wont even be able to protect yourself we can start small and build the north remembers they remember the stark name people will still risk everything for it from white harbor to ramsays own door i dont doubt it but jon doesnt have the stark name no but i do jon is every bit as much ned starks son as ramsay is roose boltons if i tell brienne to cut you down and there are also the tullys theyre not northern but they will back us against the boltons without question i didnt know the tullys still had an army my uncle the blackfish has reformed it and retaken riverrun how do you know that ramsay received a raven before i escaped winterfell thats good the blackfish is a legend his support would mean a great deal and why shouldnt i stark tully a few more houses almost starts to look like a winning side ive sworn to protect you my lady you heard them we need more men and my uncle has an army we can send the blackfish a raven cant risk ramsay intercepting it it has to be you ride for riverrun my uncle will talk to you and youll know how to talk to him do you want me to beg for my life what is it i dont like leaving you here alone with jon not him he seems trustworthy a bit brooding perhaps i suppose thats understandable considering the others though davos and the red woman helped a man murder his own brother with bloodmagic and when stannis paid for his crime where were they if thats what you want i will already out looking for a leader with better prospects and that wildling fellow with the beard jon isnt tormund jon isnt davos the red woman or stannis for that matter jon is jon hes my brother hell keep me safe i trust him then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about riverrun new dress i made it myself do you like it yeah its i like the wolf bit good because i made this for you whatever you ask that is in my power i made it like the one father used to wear as near as i can remember thank you sansa youre welcome dont knock it down

promised me dont let her suffer company halt i told them i met you in the north my lord my lord my friends the hour has come madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children but now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came madness has had its day forward march rich or poor noble or common wheres my sister did you tell them how far north if we sin we must atone margaery of house tyrell came to us a sinner she stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied she turned a blind eye to her brothers sins she disgraced her house her king and herself company halt face front well it wasnt a very large piece of parchment turn lord tyrell ser jaime sorry to interrupt were here for queen margaery and ser loras tyrell give them to us and well be on our way i dont have the authority to give them to you and you dont have the authority to take them thats right hyah you didnt tell them where im really from lock spears i speak for king tommen of house baratheon first of his name the gods dont recognize his authority in this matter youve already insulted one great house it wont happen twice every last sparrow will die before margaery tyrell walks down that street to die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us we yearn for it you didnt tell them im a wildling but there is no call for it today there will be no walk of atonement order up queen margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the seven together we announce a new age of harmony a holy alliance between the crown and the faith the thing is long live king tommen and bless you queen margaery the crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests together we will restore the seven kingdoms to glory whats happening hes beaten us thats whats happening when you attack the faith you attack the crown anyone who attacks the crown is unfit to serve as lord commander of the kingsguard my father doesnt like wildlings ive been a member of the kingsguard since before you were born you dont have to do this you dont have to do anything i have to answer to the gods not when youre sitting in that chair the crowns decision on this matter is final will i be walking naked in the streets or will i spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods mercy you have served your house and your king faithfully for many years and you will continue to do so he hoped id make a man of myself by killing some bloody wildlings but not in this city youve lost it yes father its a castle not a bloody sheep presumably you still know where it is you didnt lose riverrun you let the blackfish take it from you he surprised us he knows the castle better than anyone you did lose the blackfish after the red wedding you had him right here in this hall and you let him leave so its probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible then when i told you to hunt him down and kill him you couldnt find him thats what it means to lose something now hes come back and taken riverrun i dont think its fair to blame us for  years we kissed tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners not again riverrun is ours take it back we dont have the men i think were here weve got  times as many men as the damn blackfish the mallisters have risen against us and the blackwoods the brotherhood without banners is rallying the commoners against us raiding our supply trains and camps riverrun can withstand a siege for a year if i want excuses ill put her in charge theyre laughing at us all across the riverlands right down to kings landing theyre laughing at us sam i hear it in my sleep im not dead yet unfortunately for you and ill not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter take that castle back hell never yield father oh hell yield youll show him the knife you used to kill robb starks child in his whore mothers belly and youll show him the knife you used to open his nieces throat burn them all oh sam and youll remind him who it was that got married at the red wedding in the first place his nephew cheer up lord edmure youre going home im being sent to deal with the blackfish apparently walder frey cant manage it on his own because hes  years old sent me with an army to the riverlands and a siege that could last months oh hello mother better youre elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons im not going to the riverlands what then im going to give bronn the largest bag of gold anyones ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows ill take them to the sept and ill remove the high sparrows head and every other sparrow head i can find you cant  he has our son he stole our son i never thought id see you again hes torn our family apart how should we treat people who tear us apart we should treat them without mercy and we will but if you kill the high sparrow you wont leave the sept alive and without you this is all for nothing stand at the head of our army where you belong where father wanted you show our men where their loyalties belong show them what lannisters are what we do to our enemies you look wonderful  oh and take that stupid little castle back because its ours and because you can youll stand trial soon i need to be here for you it will be a trial by combat i have the mountain theyve made us both stronger all of them they have no idea how strong we are no idea what were going to do to them weve always been together well always be together talla were the only two people in the world why did you help us the threeeyed raven sent for me the threeeyed ravens dead now he lives again when i last saw you you were a boy a fearless boy loved to climb the castle walls frighten his mother who

walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice left me there to die to turn the children found me stopped the walkers magic from taking hold father says i have to marry symun fossoway how the same way they made the walkers in the first place you saw it yourself dragonglass a shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart you are the threeeyed raven now i didnt have time to learn i cant control anything you must learn to control it before the night king comes drink he has yellow teeth  thats enough talla one way or another he will find his way to the world of men when he does you will be there waiting for him and you will be ready everything all right how many days ride to meereen a week at best how many ships will i need to bring my khalasar to westeros dothraki and all their horses

afraid for her it just seems very dangerous shell be protected the entire way the faith militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds meera and queen margaery isnt your mother i suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf shes truly opened her heart to them shes always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate and now shes devoted to the gods as well would you like to see her have they hurt you have they mistreated you no your grace  ive missed you ,3477

sparrow against the faith  we marched for you the gods could have punished you and father but they didnt they showed mercy  and what about your brother what mercy did they show him lorass only hope is to confess his crimes and repent he must have been some kind of monster if he does the faith will allow him to return to highgarden hell have to renounce his name and title have you lost your mind  and live his life as a penitent he is the heir to highgarden the future of house tyrell he can begin again as a mindless fanatic as a free man you will leave for highgarden today there is no law that says you must stay here i am the queen he was a woman it is my duty to serve my husband the king but you should leave grandmother your place is at home i will never leave you never you must go home find comfort in prayer and good works the mother watches over us all ill see you soon my dear seven blessings to you grandmother i think some of the men are a bit afraid of you shall we pray we said wed fight with you king crow when the time comes and we meant it but this isnt what we agreed to these arent white walkers this isnt an army of the dead this isnt our fight if it werent for him none of us would be here all of you would be meat in the night kings army and id be a pile of charred bones just like mance im used to it remember mances camp it stretched all the way to the horizon and look at us now look whats left of us and if we lose this were gone dozens of tribes hundreds of generations be like we were never there at all well be the last of the free folk thats whatll happen to you if we lose the boltons the karstarks the umbers when i found you i thought youd been dead for days they know youre here they know that more than half of you are women and children after they finish with me theyll come for you youre right this isnt your fight you shouldnt have to come to winterfell with me i shouldnt be asking you its not the deal we made i need you with me if were going to beat them and we need to beat them if youre going to survive the way you were stinking already the crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would he died for us if we are not willing to do the same for him were cowards and if thats what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk snow are you sure theyll come were not clever like you southerners when we say well do something we do it and you had bugs all over you i heard you were leaving kings landing that is hardly your concern your grandson is still a prisoner youll leave him rotting in a cell loras rots in a cell because of you the high sparrow rules this city because of you our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity youre right i made a terrible mistake and bone was coming through right there i carry it with me every single day good i delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep and now we must fight them together we need each other i wonder if youre the worst person ive ever met at a certain age its hard to recall but the truly vile do stand out through the years do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells steady steady i was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed i do ill never forget it you love your granddaughter i love my son its the only truth i know we must defend them im leaving this wretched city as fast as i can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells if youre half as bright as you think you are youll find a way out of here too never oh nearly shit myself ill never leave my son whatll you do then you have no support not anymore your brothers gone the high sparrow saw to that the rest of your family have abandoned you the people despise you youre surrounded by enemies thousands of them youre going to kill them all by yourself youve lost cersei its the only joy i can find in all this misery i reckoned you were gonna die pick the pace up keep going keep it moving now that is a sorry attempt at a siege someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches someone certainly does oh no not me im just an upjumped sellsword youre an anointed knight theres quite a difference aye knights dont get paid by the time i loaded you on the wagon but you didnt you have better instincts than any officer in the lannister army thats like saying i have a bigger cock than anyone in the unsullied army i expect to command all the lannister forces before long you can be the right hand i lost you promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife and youll get all three a lannister always dont say it dont fucking say it come out and fight us blackfish we have lord edmure now i reckoned youd die a dozen more times over the next few days yield the castle or well hang him this is your last warning yield the castle you think i wont do it old man i sliced your nieces throat from ear to ear and where were you running and hiding like a fucking coward yield the castle or i cut his throat go on then cut his throat lothar is it ser jaime but you didnt what kept you going we didnt know you were coming cause you didnt set a proper perimeter you just allowed  men to approach unchallenged good thing were friends or wed be fucking you in the ass right now have lord edmure bathed and fed walder edmure is a prisoner of house frey only a fool makes threats hes not prepared to carry out now lets say i threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth but you kept talking hate what do you think id do  i dont give a rats im here by the kings command to take back this castle have him bathed and fed unless youd like to take his place apologies ser jaime do as he says the siege is now under my command the next time the blackfish looks out from those ramparts hell see an army at his gates not whatever this is have your lads start digging perimeter trenches no theres a reason youre still here set pickets every hundred yards and work doubletime on those siege towers and trebuchets those are our siege towers as i said the siege is under my command if thats not to your liking go home get word to the blackfish i want a parley a parley or a fight hes an old man youve got one hand aye theres a reason im a big fucker and im tough to kill my moneys on the old boy lady mormont welcome to bear island i remember when you were born my lady you were named for my aunt lyanna it was said she was a great beauty im sure you will be too i doubt it my mother wasnt a great beauty or any other kind of beauty she was a great warrior though she died fighting for your brother robb no a reason i served under your uncle at castle black lady lyanna he was also a great warrior and an honorable man i was his steward in fact i think weve had enough small talk why are you here stannis baratheon garrisoned at castle black before he marched on winterfell and was killed he showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men it said  i remember what it said bear island knows no king but the king in the north whose name is stark up she goes gods arent done with you yet robb is gone but house stark is not and it needs your support now more than ever ive come with my sister to ask for house mormonts allegiance as far as i understand youre a snow and lady sansa is a bolton or is she a lannister ive heard conflicting reports i did what i had to do to survive my lady but i am a stark i will always be a stark ive heard that before if you say so in any case you dont just want my allegiance you want my fighting men ramsay bolton cannot be allowed to keep winterfell my lady it is our duty to stop him even more so because he holds our brother rickon stark as prisoner what you have to understand my lady is that i understand that im responsible for bear island and all who live here so why should i sacrifice one more mormont life for someone elses war if it please my lady i understand how you feel man was talking about a different god though i dont know you ser davos my lady of house seaworth you neednt ask your maester about my house its rather new all right ser davos of house seaworth how is it you understand how i feel you never thought youd find yourself in your position being responsible for so many lives at such a young age i never thought id be in my position i was a crabbers son then i was a smuggler well maybe he was right and now i find myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war but im here because this isnt someone elses war its our war go on ser davos your uncle lord commander mormont made that man his steward he chose jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right even if it meant giving his life i dont know much about the gods because jeor mormont and jon snow both understood that the real war isnt between a few squabbling houses its between the living and the dead and make no mistake my lady the dead are coming is this true your uncle fought them at the fist of the first men i fought them at hardhome we both lost as long as the boltons hold winterfell the north is divided youre in the wrong line of work and a divided north wont stand a chance against the night king you want to protect your people my lady i understand but theres no hiding from this we have to fight and we need to do it together house mormont has kept faith with house stark for  years we will not break faith today thank you my lady how many fighting men can we expect we are not a large house oh theres plenty of pious sons of bitches but were a proud one and every man from bear island fights with the strength of  mainlanders if theyre half as ferocious as their lady the boltons are doomed kingslayer blackfish i assume youre here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece i dont see sansa and arya who think they know the word of god or gods i dont have them  pity do you wish to resume your captivity then why are you here you know why im here this castle belongs to house frey youre trespassing in the name of king tommen i order you to surrender or or youll kill edmure my nephews marked for death no matter what hang him and be done with it i dont i dont even know their real names it wont stop with edmure youll force me to storm the castle hundreds will die hundreds of mine thousands of yours if you can breach the walls well breach them and kill every last one of you but if you surrender ill spare the lives of your men on my honor your honor maybe it is the seven or maybe its the old gods bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand the war is over ser why sacrifice living men to a lost cause as long as im standing the war is not over this is my home i was born in this castle and im ready to die in it so you can either attack or try to starve us out we have enough provisions for two years do you have two years kingslayer hey come on put your back into it huh or maybe its the lord of light you clearly have no intention of saving your mens lives why did you come treat with me sieges are dull and i wanted to see you in person get the measure of you well now you have aye now i have im disappointed the answer is no lord glover if you could just hear us out  ive heard enough weve only just taken back this castle from the ironborn or maybe theyre all the same fucking thing the boltons helped us do it now you want me to fight against them i could be skinned for even talking to you the boltons are traitors roose bolton have other northern houses pledged to fight for you house mormont and we sent ravens to houses manderly i dont care about ravens youre asking me to join your army i dont know who is fighting in this army the bulk of the force is made up of wildlings then the rumors are true i didnt dare believe them i received you out of respect for your father now i would like you to leave house glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings lord glover  theres nothing else to say i would remind you that house glover what matters i believe is pledged to house stark sworn to answer when called upon yes my family served house stark for centuries we wept when we heard of your fathers death when my brother was lord of this castle he answered robbs call and hailed him king in the north and where was king robb when the ironborn attacked this castle when they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects is that theres something greater than us taking up with a foreign whore getting himself and those who followed him killed i served house stark once but house stark is dead why did we have to come here some of us still like it have a drink at least i dont want one dont go far love ill find you in a bit and whatever it is its got plans for sandor clegane nothing on the iron islands has an ass like that doesnt interest you anymore im sorry i wont joke about it ill never hurt you little brother dont you know that you think uncle eurons hunting for us of course he is as long as were alive were a threat hell find us its a great big world and we have fast ships drink you didnt know me back in my time i dont want any i dont care what you want drink drink it all youre ironborn theon i know youve had some bad years some bad years but im tired of watching you cower like a beat dog drink the goddamn ale now listen to me i need you the real theon greyjoy not this rat shit pretender you dont know the things ive done can you find him for me drink you escaped you hear me you got away and youre never going back well get justice for you if i got justice my burnt body would hang over the gates of winterfell fuck justice then well get revenge drink listen to me if youre so broken that theres no coming back take a knife and cut your wrists ive heard stories end it but if youre staying theon i need you were gonna sail to meereen were gonna make a pact with this dragon queen and were gonna take back the iron islands are you with me are you really with me now since its my last night ashore for a long while im gonna go fuck the tits off this one stannis camped here on his way to winterfell if the gods are real and thats a good thing he was the most experienced commander in westeros he chose this place for a reason those mountains are a natural fortification theres a stream down there for the horses were not staying here long another storm could hit any day aye the snows defeated stannis as much as the boltons did we have to march on winterfell now while we still can here you are son why havent they punished me wildlings hornwoods  mazins mormonts its not what wed hoped for but we still have a chance if were careful and smart for fucks sake so hes your most trusted advisor now because he secured  men from a yearold ser davos is the reason im standing here talking to you and he served stannis for years they have stannis who lost the blackwater who murdered his own brother who doesnt have a head its not enough we need more men theres no time if we went down to castle cerwyn i know that lord we fight with the army we have friends this is not worth fighting over thisll be it now right now we dont need to be fighting who the fuck are you  hold on your grace yeah who the fuck are you i was a soldier once all my superiors thought i was brave

arsonist steal that farmers crops good im your thief what are we reading today kill those young lads so they wont take up arms against us im your murderer i remember once a woman screaming at us calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut but we werent animals animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours i cut that young boys throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back the book of the mother your holiness that night i felt such shame shame was so heavy on me i couldnt eat i couldnt sleep all i could do was stare into that dark sky and listen

world chapter three verse thats all any of us can do isnt it never too late to stop robbing people to stop killing people start helping people its never too late to come back and its not about waiting

in the city varys the most famous dwarf in the world your grace several members of the faith militant have been permitted entry to the red keep the father above beckons you to his hall have been permitted thats rather a tortured way of putting it they demand to see you your grace who permitted them inside the red keep the king is aware of their presence he is your grace hes currently in his chambers at prayer your grace his holiness the high septon wishes to speak with you at the great sept of baelor his holiness the high septon in seventh heaven ill see you once more is welcome to see me here in the red keep your grace this is not a request it is a request cousin lancel you are asking me for something im refusing the high septon commands you are you sure you want to refuse him he promised me i could stay in the red keep until my trial he made no such promises if you refuse to come of your own free will get out but now i seek vengeance on sansa the whore move aside ser order your man to step aside or there will be violence i choose violence please tell his high holiness hes always welcome to visit looks like a siege my lady you have a keen military mind pod my lady my lady who goes there state your business my name is brienne of tarth and my brother the imp please inform ser jaime lannister ive come to speak with him tell him i have his sword getting a bit old to be a squire arent we podrick fucking payne i thought youd be dead by now not yet are they in there  uhhuh you think theyre fucking what no who killed his own king why not id fuck her youd fuck her wouldnt you im her squire  oh well hed fuck her thats for sure and shed fuck him dont you think the way she looks at him the way all women look at him is frankly irritating i preferred working with the little brother on that account come on youre the one with the magic cock you must have shown it to her by now born amongst lions our curse from within shes training me to fight  is she oh an hour in the morning an hour at night every day then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you well thats a different sort of fighting now thats the truth isnt it you want to learn that sort of fighting all right all right lets start with your footwork i will slay him i swear show me your stance now listen to me pod see how your feet are about a yard apart lesson number one assume everyone wants to hit you cause they do pod everyone wants to hit a fucking squire do it again come on dont sulk i never thought youd find her i just assumed sansa was dead why would you assume that in my experience girls like her dont live very long with noose or with knife i dont think you know many girls like her well im proud of you i am you fulfilled your oath to catelyn stark against all odds of course my sister wants sansa dead the girl is still a suspect in joffreys murder so there is that complication what the hell are you doing here ive come for the blackfish though it take me a fortnight youre welcome to have him lady sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the boltons and assume her rightful position as lady of winterfell with what army does she plan on taking winterfell the tully army theyre a bit occupied at the moment i was sent here to reclaim riverrun currently defended by the tully rebels so you can see the conundrum the tullys are rebels because theyre fighting for their home a moon or my life riverrun was granted to the freys by royal decree as a reward for betraying robb stark and slaughtering his family exactly we shouldnt argue about politics youre a knight ser jaime i know there is honor in you ive seen it myself  im a lannister dont ask me to betray my own house i do no such thing take riverrun without bloodshed what is that i hear and smell ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact what do you propose allow me to enter riverrun under a flag of truce let me try to persuade the blackfish to give up the castle why would he abandon his ancestral home because youll allow him to lead the tully forces safely north have you ever met the blackfish no hes even more stubborn than you are all right  someone ill soon send to hell try to talk some sense into the old goat he wont listen but his men might not everybody wants to die for someone elses home i need your word if i persuade him to abandon the castle youll grant a safe passage north you have my word you have until nightfall you gave it to me for a purpose ive achieved that purpose its time to see if truth they told its yours it will always be yours one last thing ser jaime yes lady brienne should i fail to persuade the blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle honor compels me to fight for sansas kin of course it does to fight you lets hope it doesnt come to that who said tywin lannister shits gold ive said no three times already i have a signed letter from your niece sansa stark i havent seen her since she was a child i dont know her signature i dont know you and i will not surrender double the guards tonight the kingslayer wants to try us i can feel it as i have said my name is yes brienne of tarth i know your father good man  he always spoke highly of you get the wig and if he were here now id tell him the same im telling you if you think im abandoning my familys seat on the kingslayers word of honor youre a bloody fool riverrun cannot stand against the lannisters and the freys we can stand longer than your onehanded friend thinks we can hes not my friend  no who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel ser jaime kept his word to your niece catelyn stark he sent me to find sansa to help her as catelyn wanted you beast you beast you killed my wife he gave me this sword to protect her that is what i have done and i will continue to do until the day i die shes exactly like her mother i dont have enough men to help her take winterfell you have more than she does she wants her home back i understand that but this is my home and if jaime lannister wants it he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does  and now youve taken your fathers life find the maester we need to get a raven north to sansa what should i write tell her i failed theres to be a royal announcement there is why wasnt i informed there is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment my son no worse child ever stained this land where are you going to stand by my son your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court your grace lords and ladies the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other the father judges us all i curse the day i named you if you break his laws you will be punished after conferring with his holiness the high septon we have determined that loras tyrell and cersei lannisters trial will be held in the great sept of baelor on the first day of the festival of the mother furthermore after much prayer and reflection the crown has decided that from this day forward my greatest crime trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the seven kingdoms the tradition is a brutish one a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods cersei lannister and loras tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the faith seven blessings to all seven blessings youre good at that your grace that old rumor you told me about my little birds investigated and was it just a rumor or something more more much more you seem happy i am happy you should both be happy as well where did you learn not so long ago this city was ready to devour itself now its like a man reborn i will be happy when our queen returns why dont you drink why dont either of you ever drink unsullied never drink why not  rules and who made these rules your former masters those miserable old shits didnt want you to be human have a drink with me im a jealous woman and you whats your excuse i have tried wine before it made me feel funny thats how you know its working heres to our queen anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen to daenerys stormborn mother of dragons breaker of chains long may she reign long may she reign  long may she reign do you like it ive always liked bad men tastes like it has turned yes yes fermentation one day after our queen has taken the seven kingdoms id like to have my own vineyard make my own wine the imps delight only my close friends could drink it tell me a joke missandei of naath i do not know any jokes grey worm and theyve always liked me right three lords walk into a tavern a stark a martell and a lannister they order ale but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup the lannister outraged shoves the cup aside and demands another the martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole the stark reaches into his cup pulls out the fly and shouts theyd come home wherever home was that night spit it out you wee shit spit it out its funnier in westeros the starks and the lannisters i thought these were enemies yes a joke is like a story torgo nudho not a true story necessarily a story thats supposed to make you laugh ideally not at the moment perhaps missandei do you like the wine stinking of some whores perfume i do tell a joke two translators are on a sinking ship the first says do you know how to swim the second says no but i can shout for help in  languages ah that is the worst joke i ever heard you dont even know what a joke is i am soldier all my life you think i never hear joke my firstborn son so wed fight and id put a hole in them you lied to us i make joke more jokes i once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass the madam says the masters have come for their property lord edmure i apologize for the way the freys treated you a man of your birth deserves better and then id feel terrible you have my word youll be properly fed and clothed from now on i have your word oh good good thats thats a fine thing my uncle will never surrender the castle ser whatever game youre playing

kept me in a cell for years stolen our lands ill remind you that our houses are at war im sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but rebelling against the crown does have consequences says the man who shoved his sword through his kings back did i give you the impression that this was a negotiation and good at putting holes in them its not you understand on some level you understand that youre an evil man ill leave the judgments to the gods well that is convenient for you youre a finelooking fellow arent you your square jaw your golden armor tell me i want to know i truly do and that how do you live with yourself all of us have to believe that were decent dont we you have to sleep at night how do you tell yourself that youre decent after everything that youve done i was your sisters prisoner once she hit me on the head with a rock if i remember correctly yeah what happened to the actress she should have killed you perhaps but she didnt catelyn stark hated me just like you

dont have a choice the love she had for her children the one who wanted you dead i was a little awed by it reminded me of my sister oh oh i see youre a madman im not here to trade insults your sister

to protect their babies start a war burn cities to ash free their worst enemies the things we do for love you didnt come here to talk about our sisters thats exactly why i came here i love cersei you can laugh at that if you want you can sneer doesnt matter shell have a hard time finding work as an actress she needs me and to get back to her i have to take riverrun ill send for your baby boy and ill launch him into riverrun with a catapult because you dont matter to me lord edmure your son doesnt matter to me the people in the castle dont matter to me only cersei and if i have to slaughter

reason he gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason we are part of something larger than ourselves lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves cold winds are rising in the north and youre going to go stop them you wouldnt be safe we need good men to help us last time you saw me you wanted to execute me true enough but the lord of light gave you the power to defeat me why i beat you because im better than you beric i was better than you before you started yammering on about the lord and im better than you now aye youre probably

58,9,9.9,6,despite appearances i think youll find the citys on the rise the masters cannot let meereen succeed get off your horse and kneel im a man of mercy youre right theres no need for a battle thousands of men dont need to die only one of us lets end this the old way you against me i keep hearing stories about you bastard the way people in the north talk about you because if meereen succeeds a city without slavery youre the greatest swordsman who ever walked maybe you are that good maybe not i dont know if id beat you but i know that my army will beat yours i have  men you have what half that not even aye you have the numbers will your men want to fight for you a city without masters when they hear you wouldnt fight for them hes good very good tell me will you let your little brother die because youre too proud to surrender how do we know you have him now if you want to save youre going to die tomorrow lord bolton sleep well shes a fine woman your sister i look forward to having her back in my bed it proves that no one needs a master and youre all finelooking men my dogs are desperate to meet you i havent fed them for seven days theyre ravenous i wonder which parts theyll try first your eyes your balls well find out soon enough in the morning then bastard if he was smart hed stay inside the walls of winterfell and wait us out good thats not his way he knows the north is watching if the other houses sense weakness on his part theyll stop fearing him he cant have that fear is his power its his weakness too his men dont want to fight for him theyre forced to fight for him if they feel the tide turning its not his men that worry me its his horses i know what mounted knights can do to us you and stannis cut through us like piss through snow shall we begin were digging trenches all along our flanks they wont be able to hit us the way that stannis hit you in a double envelopment a pincer move they wont be able to hit us from the sides good its crucial that we let them charge at us theyve got the numbers we need the patience if we let him buckle our center hell pursue then well have him surrounded on three sides do we have a plan did you really think that cunt would fight you mantoman no but i wanted to make him angry i want him coming at us full tilt we should all get some sleep rest jon snow we need you sharp tomorrow so youve met the enemy drawn up your battle plans aye for what theyre worth youve known him for the space of a single conversation i will crucify the masters you and your trusted advisors and you sit around making your plans on how to defeat a man you dont know i lived with him i know the way his mind works i know how he likes to hurt people did it ever once occur to you that i might have some insight youre right you think hes going to fall into your trap he wont hes the one who lays traps i will set their fleets afire hes overconfident  he plays with people hes far better at it than you hes been doing it all his life aye and what have i been doing all my life playing with broomsticks i fought beyond the wall against worse than ramsay bolton ive defended the wall from worse than ramsay bolton you dont know him all right tell me what should we do how do we get rickon back well never get him back rickon is ned starks trueborn son kill every last one of their soldiers which makes him a greater threat to ramsay than you a bastard or me a girl as long as he lives ramsays claim to winterfell will be contested which means he wont live long we cant give up on our brother listen to me please he wants you to make a mistake of course he does what should i do differently i dont know i dont know anything about battles just dont do what he wants you to do aye thats good advice perhaps we should take shelter and return their cities to the dirt you think thats obvious well it is a bit obvious if you had asked for my advice earlier i would have told you not to attack winterfell until we had a larger force or is that obvious too when will we have a larger force weve pleaded with every house thatll have us the blackfish cant help us were lucky to have this many men its not enough  no its not enough its what we have that is my plan battles have been won against greater odds if ramsay wins im not going back there alive do you understand me i wont let ever let him touch you again ill protect you i promise no one can protect me no one can protect anyone you think theres hope ive never seen these bolton fuckers fight you dont approve and theyve never seen the free folk fight so yes theres hope you want to avenge your king dont you it wasnt the boltons defeated stannis it was stannis himself i loved the man he lifted me up and made me something but he had demons in his skull whispering foul things you saw these demons  what no its a manner of speaking you once told me you knew what your father was not actual demons well you loved that cunt stannis and i loved the man he burned mance didnt have demons in his skull he didnt torch people or listen to some red witch i believed in him i thought he was the man to lead us through the long night but i was wrong just like you maybe that was our mistake believing in kings jon snows not a king did you know his plans for kings landing no hes not i need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight you want some i have a jug of sour goats milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on no thanks it does sound delicious but i better keep a clear head i can never sleep the night before a battle so what do you do all night when the lannister armies were at his gates i walk think and walk think and walk until im far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out happy shitting my lady you werent at the war council im not a soldier any advice dont lose probably not if i do if i fall dont bring me back ill have to try im ordering you not to bring me back i am not your servant jon snow youre in my camp im the commander i serve the lord of light i do what he commands how do you know what he commands i interpret his signs well he told my brother and jaime told me as well as i can if the lord didnt want me to bring you back how did i bring you back i have no power only what he gives me and he gave me you why i dont know maybe youre only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else maybe he brought you here to die again what kind of god would do something like that he had caches of wildfire hidden under the red keep the one weve got last time we saw each other was at winterfell yes you were making jokes about my height i seem to recall everyone who makes a joke about a dwarfs height thinks hes the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarfs height the height of nobility a man of your stature someone to look up to youre all making the same five or six jokes it was a long time ago  it was and how have things been going for you since then the guildhalls the sept of baelor not so well i gather cant imagine you would have murdered the stark boys if things had been going well i didnt murder the stark boys but i did things that were just as bad or worse and he paid for them doesnt seem like it hes still alive it was complicated for you im sure growing up at winterfell never quite knowing who you were the citys on the rise all the major thoroughfares but then we all live complicated lives dont we youve brought us  ships from the iron fleet with men to sail them in return i expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the iron islands not my claim hers and whats wrong with you im not fit to rule we can agree upon that at least has the iron islands ever had a queen before he would have burned every one of his citizens no more than westeros our uncle euron returned home after a long absence he murdered our father and took the salt throne from yara he would have murdered us if wed stayed lord tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king you and i have that in common we do and both murdered by a usurper as well will their ships be enough with the former masters fleet possibly the loyal ones and the traitors barely there are more than  ships in the iron fleet there are and euron is building more hes going to offer them to you so why shouldnt i wait for him the iron fleet isnt all hes bringing he also wants to give you his big cock i think he said eurons offer is also an offer of marriage you see you wont get one without the other every man woman and child and i imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands i never demand but im up for anything really he murdered our father and would have murdered us hell murder you as soon as you have what he wants the seven kingdoms all of them and you dont want the seven kingdoms your ancestors defeated ours and took the iron islands we ask you to give them back and thats all thats why jaime killed him wed like you to help us murder an uncle or two who dont think a womans fit to rule reasonable what if everyone starts demanding their independence shes not demanding shes asking the others are free to ask as well our fathers were evil men all of us here they left the world worse than they found it were not going to do that were going to leave the world better than we found it this is entirely different you will support my claim as queen of the seven kingdoms and respect the integrity of the seven kingdoms no more reaving roving raiding or raping thats our way of life no more no more do you like games little man lets play a game run to your brother the sooner you make it to him youre talking about destroying cities the sooner you get to see him again thats it thats the game easy ready go no you have to run remember those are the rules `t`u`s`u`b`t`i`t`u`l`o`c`o`m dont its not entirely different prepare to charge prepare to charge draw  draw draw loose go go follow your commander run and fight nock draw  draw loose  loose id

homeland with a fleet of ships open the gate archers to the wall their armys gone  our armys gone we have winterfell they dont have the men for a siege all we have to do is wait archers to the wall

father jon where is he sansa hello sansa is this where ill be staying now no our time together is about to come to an end thats all right like the beggar queen you are you cant kill me im part of you

theyre loyal beasts we are here to discuss terms of surrender they were now theyre starving sit down down down down down not to trade insults the terms are simple you and your foreign friends will abandon the great pyramid and the city of meereen the unsullied you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder commerce has returned to the markets the translator you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder the dragons beneath the great pyramid will be slaughtered we obviously didnt communicate clearly were here to discuss your surrender not mine i imagine its difficult adjusting to the new reality your reign is over my reign has just begun dracarys the people are behind you your men have a choice fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you or go home to your families thank you for the armada our queen does love ships now last time we spoke we made a pact you violated that pact you declared war upon us though our queen does have a forgiving nature this cannot be forgiven well not all the people of course our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes it always seems a bit abstract doesnt it other people dying him he should die yes him hes not one of us hes an outsider a lowborn he does not speak for us please please no ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people tell your people what happened here tell them you live by the grace of her majesty when they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory remind them what happened when daenerys stormborn and her dragons came to meereen you dont have to be here yes i do my beloved wife ive missed you terribly but the rebirth of meereen is the cause of this violence thank you for returning lady bolton safely now dismount and kneel before me surrender your army and proclaim me the true lord of winterfell and warden of the north i will pardon you for deserting the nights watch i will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house come bastard you dont have the men you dont have the horses and you dont have

robb stark the young wolf but it doesnt matter here we are now two kingslayers we know what its like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs we dont mind do we the trial will be getting under way soon and arrogance fear is a marvelous thing they dont fear the freys though they fear the lannisters we gave you the riverlands to hold the riverlands if we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you show me your grace theres no need show me i see that now what are your thoughts concerning the kings funeral as the sept of baelor is

lord willed it i loved that girl like she was my own she was good she was kind and you killed her so did her father the warrior punishes those who believe themselves so did her mother her own blood

sword is yours my life is yours this is what i command if im going to rule in westeros ill need to make alliances you understand fully the best way to make alliances is with marriage who are you

hope it brings you happiness i pity the lords of westeros they have no idea whats coming for them farewell daario naharis how did he take it no tears i know it was hard for you you turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the seven kingdoms thats the kind of selfsacrifice that makes for a good ruler later go away and all that goes with it if its any consolation its not no i suppose not im terrible at consoling yes you really are all right how about the fact that this is actually happening you have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons everything youve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything i will renounce my lordship and my claims on highgarden its all yours for the taking are you afraid good youre in the great game now and the great games terrifying the only people who arent afraid of failure are madmen like your father do you know what frightens me i said farewell to a man who loves me a man i thought i cared for i will never marry and i felt nothing just impatient to get on with it he wasnt the first to love you and he wont be the last well you have completely failed to console me for what its worth ive been a cynic for as long as i can remember everyones always asking me to believe in things family gods kings myself it was often tempting until i saw where belief got people and i will never father children so i said no thank you to belief and yet here i am i believe in you its embarrassing really id swear you my sword but i dont actually own a sword its your counsel i need its yours now and always good brother loras i i had something made for you im not sure if its right tyrion lannister i name you hand of the queen youre not one of mine are you no my lord didnt think so

to make this picture a reality pull it out of my mind i will and into the world and i only act if the answer is yes a picture of me on the iron throne and you by my side its a pretty picture news of this battle will spread quickly through the seven kingdoms ive declared for house stark for all to hear youve declared for other houses before lord baelish its never stopped you from serving yourself no i cant let them the past is gone for good you can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future you my love are the future of house stark who should the north rally behind a trueborn daughter of ned and catelyn stark born here at winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south this is where i leave you grand maester faith is the way father youre not coming with us the wall is not just ice and stone ancient spells were carved into its foundations strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond and while it stands the dead cannot pass i cannot pass where will

invited not by me the free folk the northerners and the knights of the vale fought bravely fought together and we won you mutilated him my father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield the boltons are defeated the war is over winter has come if the maesters are right itll be the coldest one in a thousand years we should ride home and wait out the coming storms the war is not over and i promise you friend the true enemy wont wait out the storm he brings the storm you gave me your word your son was butchered at the red wedding lord manderly but you refused the call you swore allegiance to house stark lord glover but in their hour of greatest need you refused the call and you lord cerwyn your father was skinned alive by ramsay bolton still you refused the call but house mormont remembers the north remembers and i have kept my word we know no king but the king in the north whose name is stark i dont care if hes a bastard ned starks blood runs through his veins hes my king from this day until his last day lady mormont speaks harshly and truly my son died for robb stark the young wolf i didnt think wed find another king in my lifetime i didnt commit my men to your cause cause i didnt want more manderlys dying for nothing once the queen mothers trial is concluded but i was wrong jon snow avenged the red wedding he is the white wolf the king in the north i did not fight beside you on the field and i will regret that until my dying day a man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness theres nothing to forgive my lord there will be more fights to come brother loras is free to leave house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousand years and i will stand behind jon snow the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north company halt halt halt come on ser loras tyrell and where is the queen mother i now proclaim cersei of the house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms long may she reign long may she reign her litter never left the red keep it appears the queen mother doesnt wish to attend her own trial go to the red keep and show her the way get the others wheres the king elsewhere im afraid whats the meaning of this i was told that i have more important things to do with my time are you prepared to stand trial than waste them in the presence please grand maester i bear you no ill will please forgive me if you can this pains me my lord whatever your faults you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold dark place but sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to rest the longer you wait the worse itll be for you what are you doing and profess your guilt or innocence before the seven theres something wrong you have nothing to fear your grace the trial will begin shortly cersei is not here tommen is not here why do you think theyre not here if the accused is not here she will be tried regardless we cannot escape the justice of the gods forget about the bloody gods and listen to what im telling you cersei understands the consequences of her absence therell be no need for a trial and she is absent anyway which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences the trial can wait we all need to leave we all need to leave now loras stay with me let me through let me through get out of my way let us through confess ,3486
60,1,8.7,7,ua  ua im meera reed daughter of howland reed this is brandon stark son of ned stark how do i know thats true you were at the fist of the first men you were at hardhome youve seen the army of the dead youve seen the night king hes coming for us for all of us our uncle euron returned home after a long absence okay come on lets get them inside jon i want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass dragonglass kills white walkers its more valuable to us now than gold we need to find it we need to mine it we need to make weapons from it everyone aged  to will drill daily with spears pikes bow and arrow its about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight   not just the boys we cant defend the north if only half the population is fighting you expect me to put a spear in my granddaughters hand i dont plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me i might be small lord glover and i might be a girl but i am every bit as much a northerner as you indeed you are my lady no one has questioned theon greyjoy he murdered our father and took the salt throne from yara and i dont need your permission to defend the north well begin training every man woman boy and girl on bear island men aye  while were preparing for attack we need to shore up our defenses the only thing standing between us and the army of the dead is the wall and the wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries im not the king of the free folk but if were going to survive this winter together he would have murdered us if wed stayed you want us to man the castles for you   jon aye last time we saw the night king was at hardhome the closest castle to hardhome is eastwatchbythesea then thats where ill go looks like were the nights watch now if they breach the wall the first two castles in their path are last hearth and karhold build me a thousand ships and i will give you this world the umbers and the karstarks betrayed the north their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing the castles committed no crimes and we need every fortress we have for the war to come we should give the last hearth and karhold to new families loyal families who supported us against ramsay men aye the umbers and the karstarks have fought beside the starks for centuries theres a storm coming theyve kept faith for generation after generation  and then they broke faith im not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons sansa so theres no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty the punishment for treason is death smalljon umber died on the field of battle harald karstark died on the field of battle they died fighting for ramsay give the castles to the families youll be wanting a roof tonight of the men who died fighting for you when i was lord commander of the nights watch i executed men who betrayed me i executed men who refused to follow orders my father always said the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and i have tried to live by those words but i will not punish a son for his fathers sins and i will not take a family home away i dont have much but i have hidden a bit of silver from a family it has belonged to for centuries that is my decision and my decision is final ned umber alys karstark for centuries our families fought side by side on the battlefield i ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to house stark to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon from the bandits   stand yesterdays wars dont matter anymore the north needs to band together all the living north will you stand beside me ned and alys now and always both now and always jon you are my sister but i am king now will you start wearing a crown ua  ua arya stark what did you do when you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies you undermine me so i cant question your decisions anymore  of course you can but joffrey never let anyone question his authority you think he was a good king do you think im joffrey youre as far from joffrey as anyone ive ever met thank you youre good at this you know at what  at ruling theyll both be dead come winter  no you are you are they respect you they really do but you have to   why are you laughing what did father used to say everything before the word but is horse shit he never said that to me no no he never cursed in front of his girls beric dondarrion cold winds are rising in the north sansa because he was trying to protect us he never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is but father couldnt protect me and neither can you stop trying  all right ill stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me im not trying to undermine you you have to be smarter than father you need to be smarter than robb i loved them i miss them but they made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it we need good men to help us and how should i be smarter by listening to you would that be so terrible a raven from kings landing your grace cersei of house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms what does she want  come to kings landing bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors you can still help a lot more than youve harmed clegane youve been so consumed with the enemy to the north youve forgotten about the one to the south im consumed with the night king because ive seen him and believe me youd think of little else if you had too we still have a wall between us and the night king theres nothing between us and cersei theres a thousand miles between us and cersei winter is here the lannisters are a southern army theyve never ranged this far north youre the military man but i know her its not too late for you if youre her enemy shell never stop until shes destroyed you everyone whos ever crossed her shes found a way to murder you almost sound as if you admire her i learned a great deal from her what is this its what weve been waiting for our whole lives its what father trained us for whether he knew it or not he knew it made me memorize every damn city town lake forest and mountain samwell tarly send me to oldtown its ours now we just have to take it youve been quiet since you came home are you angry with me no not angry are you afraid of me should i be daenerys targaryen has chosen tyrion to be her hand right now theyre sailing across the narrow sea hoping to take back her fathers throne our little brother im to be the new maester the one you love so much the one you set free the one who murdered our father and our firstborn son now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel hes out there somewhere at the head of an armada where will they land dragonstone they have deepwater ports for the ships stannis left the castle unoccupied and thats where she was born the citadel has the worlds greatest library enemies to the east enemies to the south ellaria sand and her brood of bitches enemies to the west olenna the old cunt another traitor enemies to the north ned starks bastard has been named king in the north and that murdering whore sansa stands beside him enemies everywhere were surrounded by traitors ill learn about things that all help when youre in command of the lannister army now how do we proceed  winter is here we cant win a war if we cant feed our men and our horses the tyrells have the grain the tyrells have the livestock will the tyrell bannermen stand alongside a dothraki horde and unsullied slave soldiers if they think daenerys will win no one wants to fight on the losing side right now we look like the losing side im the queen of the seven kingdoms three kingdoms at best im not sure you understand how much danger were in i understand were in a war for survival i understand whoever loses dies i understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years a dynasty for whom our children are dead were the last of us a dynasty for us then samwell when they come we never talked about tommen theres nothing to say our baby boy killed himself he betrayed me he betrayed us both should we spend our days mourning the dead mother father and all our children cersei  i loved them i did but theyre ashes now and were still flesh and blood were the last lannisters the last ones who count even lannisters cant survive without allies where are our allies now you saw what happened to walder frey and his family i heard how could we ever trust a man like that  we couldnt he was a useless old coward but the freys supported us now theyre all dead whoever killed them is no friend of ours we need allies stronger better allies we cant win this war alone you think i listened to father for  years and learned nothing jaime the greyjoys you invited the greyjoys to kings landing not all of them  well it looks like all of them i invited euron greyjoy the new king of the iron islands you said yourself we needed stronger better allies let go of me   there you are  how are they better allies how are they different from the freys they both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them so does everyone when it suits them unlike the freys they have ships and theyre good at killing  theyre not good at anything i know the ironborn theyre bitter angry little people all they know how to do is steal things they cant build or grow themselves euron greyjoy didnt come here for that oh what did he come here for then a queen euron the moment i was chosen lord of the iron islands they turned on me  their own uncle they stole my best ships and ran sailed them right across the world and gave them to the dragon queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you its nothing compared to the treason you suffered are you sure youre ready for this at the hands of a family member from what i hear but still it bothers me murdering them would make me feel a lot better and since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side i thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together youre not a rightful monarch though are you the greyjoys rebelled against the throne for the right to be monarchs but as i recall you were soundly defeated im the threeeyed raven i have to be ready for this come to mention it werent you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to casterly rock and burning the lannister fleet you certainly caught us there very smart move on your part of course we all made it to the iron islands anyway i was there i remember very well i saw you i heard so much talk ua  ua the best in the world no one can stop him i didnt believe it to be honest but i must say when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down it was glorious like a dance the people i was cutting down were your own kin the place was getting crowded i enjoyed watching it i truly did and i enjoyed killing greyjoys do you know who had this table carved and painted ser davos a good thing for me if you hadnt crushed us i wouldnt have gone into exile if i hadnt done that i wouldnt be the greatest captain on the  seas if not the most humble youre not humble youre the queen of a great nation you dont care about the iron islands theyre nothing but rocks and bird shit and and a lot of very unattractive people ua  ua aegon targaryen the iron fleet on the other hand thats something else entirely its the greatest armada westeros has ever seen with the iron fleet you own the seas you can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south what do you want in return ever since i was a little boy i wanted to grow up and marry the most beautiful woman in the world aegon used to live here and the targaryens built this castle so here i am with a thousand ships and two good hands i decline your proposal why youre not trustworthy youve broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity you murdered your own brother you should try it feels wonderful davos seaworth aye so they did i dont expect you to trust me outright you need proof of my honest intentions in my experience the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift a priceless gift i wont return to kings landing until i have that for you i want us both to go home but they took it from us how do we go home ah maester weyland  a drinkers liver if ever i saw one tyrion lannister youre in the great game now weigh that the triumph of transitory pleasures mankinds curse archmaester i was wondering whats the weight um i was wondering if you had considered my proposition i dont remember your proposition i asked you if in light of what ive seen in the north if i could have access to the restricted area of the library and the great games terrifying are you afraid that area is reserved for maesters are you a maester  no not a very strong proposition is it archmaester with respect ive seen them the army of the dead the white walkers i was sent here to learn how to defeat them but everyone in the citadel those who will even talk to me my name is arya stark i want you to know that they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place everyone in the citadel doubts everything its their job but the tales of the long night cant be pure fabrication too many similarities from unconnected sources sources in the restricted area the very same and the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that youre telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw so you believe me i do youll finish weighing that heart that makes you the only person south of the twins who does were not like the people south of the twins and were not like the people north of the twins in the citadel we lead different lives for different reasons we are this worlds memory samwell tarly without us men would be little better than dogs dont remember any meal but the last cant see forward to any but the next and every time you leave the house and shut the door they howl like youre gone forever when roberts rebellion was raging people thought the end was near the end of the targaryen dynasty how will we survive when aegon targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to blackwater rush the end is near how will we survive the war is over winter has come ua  ua and thousands of years before that during the long night we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end but it wasnt none of it was the wall has stood through it all and every winter that ever came has ended be a good lad clean this up nope   nope   youre a lucky man littlefinger ive heard she beat the hound in single combat shes a very impressive woman what do you want lord baelish i want you to be happy i want you to be safe i am safe im at home surrounded by friends i have brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me what about happy

youre wondering why i brought you all here why is he still here  we need his men without the vale ramsay bolton would still hold this castle littlefinger saved us brienne he wants something i know exactly what he wants man ua he rode through the streets of the city ua ua down from his hill on high ua ua oer the winds and the steps and the cobbles ua after all we just had a feast ua he rode to a womans sigh ua ua for she was his secret treasure ua ua she was his shame and his bliss ua ua and a chain and a keep are nothing ua ua compared to a womans kiss ua men ua for hands of gold are always

part of the army thats been sent to keep the peace here you go guests first oh no i couldnt you dont have enough my mother always told me to be kind to strangers strangers will be kind to you youre a long way from home im sure youve had some adventures though well its no good being lord of the riverlands yeah endless adventures theyll be singing about us for a thousand years   the truth is when we left home we couldnt wait to get away but now weve been gone a while we cant wait to get home i just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone i ought to be out there with him my wife just had our first baby boy or girl  oh who knows you think soldiers get ravens with news from home if you cant celebrate with your family i hope its a girl  why girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old boys just go off to fight in someone elses wars man ua are you old enough to drink its blackberry wine i made it myself its really good so why is a nice girl on her own heading to kings

didnt think this is important jon needs to know im not wasting good wine on a damn woman jorah has she come yet who the dragon queen daenerys stormborn havent heard anything maybe im not the most pleasant man shall we begin ill admit it but im proud of you lot youre my family the men who helped me slaughter the starks at the red wedding   walder yes yes cheer brave men all of you butchered a woman pregnant with her babe cut the throat of a mother of five slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home but you didnt slaughter every one of the starks   no no that was your mistake

61,2,9.0,7,ellaria the lannisters have declared war on house tyrell of better men you wish to know where my true loyalties lie not with any king or queen but with the people the people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule the people whose hearts you aim to win if you demand blind allegiance i respect your wishes grey worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me but if you let me live i will serve you well i will dedicate myself to seeing you on the iron throne because i choose you sam its a map of dragonstone because i know the people have no better chance than you swear this to me varys if you ever think im failing the people you wont conspire behind my back youll look me in the eye as you have done today and youll tell me how im failing them i swear it my queen and i swear this if you ever betray me ill burn you alive i would expect nothing less from the mother of dragons gilly thats dragonglass forgive me my queen a red priestess from asshai has come to see you she once served another who wanted the iron throne it didnt end well for stannis baratheon did it no it didnt you chose an auspicious day to arrive at dragonstone weve just decided to pardon those who once served the wrong king the lord of light doesnt have many followers in westeros does he a mountain of it beneath the ground not yet but even those who dont worship the lord can serve his cause what does your lord expect from me the prince who was promised will bring the dawn im afraid im not a prince missandei your grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate that noun has no gender in high valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn john needs to know doesnt really roll off the tongue does it no but i like it better and you believe this prophecy refers to me prophecies are dangerous things i believe you have a role to play as does another the king in the north jon snow jon snow ned starks bastard  you know him i travelled with him to the wall when he joined the nights watch you must send me away and why do you think the lord of light singled out this jon snow aside from the visions youve seen in the flames that is as lord commander of the nights watch he allowed the wildlings south of the wall to protect them from grave danger as king in the north he has united those wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy he sounds like quite a man summon jon snow i command you to heal yourself let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes i cant speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but i like jon snow and i trusted him and i am an excellent judge of character if he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally the lannisters executed his father i command you to find the cure and conspired to murder his brother jon snow has even more reason to hate cersei than you do very well send a raven north tell jon snow that his queen invites him to come to dragonstone and bend the knee gather round come here sansa you think its really tyrion so whys a nice girl on her own heading to kings landing it could be someone trying to lure you into a trap read the last bit all dwarves are bastards in their fathers eyes what does that mean its something he said to me the first night we met you know him better than any of us what do you think tyrions not like the other lannisters he was always kind to me but its too great a risk the seven kingdoms will bleed im going to kill the queen as long as cersei sits on the iron throne join us together we can end her tyranny sounds like a charmer of course the casual mention of a dothraki horde a legion of unsullied and three dragons a bit less charming what fire kills wights you told me what breathes fire they have declared war on dorne i invited euron greyjoy youre not suggesting jon meet with her no too dangerous  but but if the army of the dead makes it past the wall do we have enough men to fight them if the mad kings daughter takes the iron throne shell destroy the realm as we know it some of you are bannermen of house tyrell but house tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown with their help the mad kings daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores the new king of the iron islands mindless unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your women and butcher your children without a second thought this is how olenna tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty   cersei you all remember the mad king you remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people his daughter is no different in essos her brutality is already legendary she crucified hundreds of noblemen in slavers bay the iron fleet is the greatest armada westeros has ever seen and when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons it is my solemn duty to protect the people and i will but i need your help my lords we must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her she has three fullgrown dragons your grace the same as aegon when he conquered the seven kingdoms the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift how do you propose to stop them we are currently at work on a solution my lord lord tarly ser jaime i believe you know my son ser jaime rickard isnt it dickon thats it i wont return to kings landing until i have that for you thank you for coming the other lords of the reach look to you for guidance now more than ever they might not have come if you hadnt if my queen summons me i answer the call and ive heard what she does to those who defy her you ride for horn hill today i have an army to mobilize wont be long before the fighting starts and which side will you be fighting for you were the only man to defeat robert baratheon in battle shall we begin not even rhaegar targaryen could do that its a long ride back to the reach ser jaime how may i serve i want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come i want you to swear allegiance to cersei and i want you to help me destroy her enemies all her enemies including olenna tyrell im a tarly that name means something were not oathbreakers were not schemers we dont stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings i swore an oath to house tyrell you swore an oath to the crown as well lord tarly ive known olenna since i was a child she was a great woman once now shes broken she wants revenge so badly she brought the dothraki to our shores the dothraki in westeros for the first time in history i know you dont like my sister but you have to make a choice do you fight with us or with foreign savages and eunuchs when the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south i can think of no better man than randyll tarly ebrose the infection has spread too far you should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched tyrion on a night like this you came into the world how long itll be years before it kills you could be could be but how long until your mind six months maybe fewer um pardon archmaester varys i remember that storm i met stannis baratheons daughter at castle black she had the greyscale as a baby and was cured ebrose no  isnt there some way ebrose does this look like a baby to you no  have you studied the varying rates of greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men no ebrose maester cressen discovered shireen baratheons affliction immediately we must be allies now if we wish to survive all the dogs in kings landing this is quite advanced and beyond our skills ser were you a commoner id have you shipped to valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men as an anointed knight ill allow you one more day how you choose to spend that time is up to you come samwell should we send word to your family ser jorah jorah mormont howled through the night mormont theres no need ive been dead to them for years ebrose come samwell qyburn have you ever been down here your grace no i cant say i have i havent seen these since robert had them removed from the throne room curious that king robert did not have them destroyed they were his trophies he couldnt keep them around i wish i could remember it they would have made him look small sometimes he would come down here and look at them i believe he brought his whores on occasion balerion the dread the beast that aegon rode across the sea his flames forged the iron throne and brought the seven kingdoms to heel powerful but not invincible apparently one of daeneryss dragons i always thought this would be a homecoming was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of meereen and if they can be wounded they can be killed the finest artillators and blacksmiths in kings landing have been laboring day and night your grace if youll kindly pull that lever yara if you want the iron throne take it we have an army a fleet and three dragons we should hit kings landing now hard with everything we have the city will fall within a day doesnt feel like home if we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms its called war you dont have the stomach for it scurry back into hiding i know how you wage war we dont poison little girls here myrcella was innocent she was a lannister there are no innocent lannisters my greatest regret is that oberyn died fighting for you daenerys thats enough we wont stay on dragonstone for long lord tyrion is hand of the queen you will treat him with respect i am not here to be queen of the ashes thats very nice to hear of course i cant remember a queen who was better loved than my granddaughter the common people loved her the nobles loved her and what is left of her now ashes good commoners nobles theyre all just children really they wont obey you unless they fear you im grateful to you lady olenna for your counsel im grateful to all of you but you have chosen to follow me i will not attack kings landing we will not attack kings landing then how do you mean to take the iron throne by asking nicely daenerys not so many lions we will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides cersei will have the iron throne but no food for her army or the people but we wont use dothraki and unsullied cersei will try to rally the lords of westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country if we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point varys cersei controls fewer than half the seven kingdoms our army should be westerosi and i suppose were providing the westerosi you are lady greyjoy will escort you home to sunspear and her iron fleet will ferry the dornish army back up to kings landing the dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the tyrell army two great kingdoms united against cersei so your master plan is to use our armies the lords of westeros despise her forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own the unsullied will have another objective for decades house lannister has been the true power in westeros and the seat of that power is casterly rock grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock and take it do i have your support you have mine dorne is with you your grace thank you all i offer vengeance justice even before your arrival they plotted against her lady olenna may i speak with you alone i realize youre here out of hatred for cersei and not love for me but i swear to you she will pay for what shes done and we will bring peace back to westeros peace do you think thats what we had under your father or his father or his peace never lasts my dear will you take a bit of advice from an old woman now  they cry out for their true queen hes a clever man your hand ive known a great many clever men ive outlived them all you know why i ignored them the lords of westeros are sheep are you a sheep no youre a dragon be a dragon they drink secret toasts to my health   grey worm majued you leave tomorrow were you going to say goodbye i will see you when i return but you dont know when that will be no one knows i wish you good fortune missandei it is hard for me to say goodbye to you people used to tell my brother that sort of thing why you know why i dont yyou are my weakness thats what i am your weakness when unsullied are young the masters learn their fears one boy is scared of dogs one boy hates high places one is frightened of the ocean and he was stupid enough to believe them they make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff they throw him in the water if he learns to swim good if he drowns good either way strong unsullied but i had no fears i was never the biggest never the strongest but i was bravest always i believe it  until if viserys had three dragons and an army at his back i meet missandei from the isle of naath now i have fear i do too no i want to see you please might be useful chvyalthan was a dreadful writer hed have invaded kings landing already but an excellent researcher archmaester i wondered if i  and this one maester faull was quite the opposite a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells um i wanted to ask you if youre going to write histories tarly you have to do the research if you want people to read your histories you need a bit of style im not writing a chronicle of the wars conquering westeros would be easy for you following the death of king robert i so it can sit on a shelf unread what you dont like the title what would you call it then mm possibly something a bit more poetic were not poets tarly um archmaester if i could just have a moment this is your moment use it wisely i may have found a way to treat ser jorah but youre not here to be queen of the ashes there are two recorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured i found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by archmaester pylos im familiar with archmaester pylos and his study of rare diseases oh you are  yes and shall i tell you how he died from greyscale oh  the procedures far too dangerous no which is why its now forbidden hello what are you doing   youre jorah mormont the only son of jeor mormont my name is samwell tarly sworn brother of the nights watch training to serve as maester at castle black fire and blood we can take the seven kingdoms i knew your father i was with him when he died you are not dying today ser jorah drink this what is it  rum drink it all please im afraid this is going to hurt if you could take off your shirt without turning it into a slaughterhouse if you wouldnt mind bite down hard im sorry but no one knows im here and if they hear you screaming then were both finished jorah have you ever done this before no but no one else will try it so im the best youve got have a seat im going to have to remove the entire upper layer of infected tissue then apply a medicinal ointment to the   shh shh if the great houses support your claim against cersei shh again im sorry but please try not to scream they say her dragons are bigger than aegons the game is won horseshit cerseis just trying to frighten us i hope its true if she lays siege to kings landing prices will triple as long as we get back there before they start one more round its a long ride hot pie arry hello hot pie sit down whos that for mm this is good with the tyrell army and the dornish on our side you think so the secret is browning the butter before making the dough most people dont do that cause it takes up too much time mm i didnt do that youve been making pies one or two i cant believe youre here did you meet the big lady big lady  the lady knight you know i figured she was a knight cause she had armor on we have powerful allies in the south she was looking for your sister but i told her about you did she ever find you she found me what happened to you arry you got any ale where you heading  kings landing why  heard cerseis queen now heard she blew up the great sept that must have been something to see i never properly thanked you for that boom  mm i cant believe someone would do that cersei would do that i thought youd be heading for winterfell why would i go there the boltons have it no the boltons are dead what jon snow came down from castle black with a wildling army and won the battle of the bastards hes king of the north now they joined our side my queen youre lying why would i lie about that hes your brother right thanks for the pie   friends dont pay cant believe i thought you were a boy youre pretty thanks take care of yourself hot pie try not to get killed because they believe in you ah i wont im like you arry  im a survivor miles to kings landing one bottle of rum you think well make it come in a raven my king from the citadel jon this message was sent to me by samwell tarly you served my father didnt you lord varys he was my brother at the nights watch a man i trust as much as anyone in this world hes discovered proof that dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass i received this a few days ago from dragonstone it was sent to me by tyrion lannister he is now hand of the queen to daenerys targaryen sam i traveled south i did she intends to take the iron throne from cersei lannister she has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed three dragons jon lord tyrion has invited me to dragonstone to meet with daenerys and im going to accept   man accept we need this dragonglass my lords and then you served the man who overthrew him we know that dragonglass can destroy both white walkers and their army we need to mine it and turn it into weapons but more importantly we need allies the night kings army grows larger by the day we cant defeat them on our own we dont have the numbers daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire i need to try and persuade her to fight with us ser davos and i will ride for white harbor tomorrow i had a choice your grace then sail for dragonstone have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather the mad king invited him to kings landing and roasted him alive  i know that she is here to reclaim the iron throne and the seven kingdoms the north is one of those seven kingdoms this isnt an invitation; its a trap it could be but i dont believe tyrion would do that you know him hes a good man your grace with respect i must agree with lady sansa serve robert baratheon or face the headmans axe i remember the mad king all too well a targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a lannister  all yeah aye we called your brother king and then he rode south and lost his kingdom winter is here your grace we need the king in the north in the north men aye   you all crowned me your king i never wanted it but you didnt serve him long i never asked for it but i accepted it because the north is my home its part of me and i will never stop fighting for it no matter the odds but the odds are against us none of you have seen the army of the dead none of you we can never hope to defeat them alone we need allies powerful allies i know its a risk but i have to take it you turned against him then send an emissary dont go yourself daenerys is a queen only a king can convince her to help us it has to be me youre abandoning your people youre abandoning your home im leaving both in good hands whose  yours you are my sister youre the only stark in winterfell robert was an improvement on your father to be sure until i return the north is yours littlefinger i delivered his bones myself presented them to lady catelyn as a gesture of goodwill from tyrion lannister seems like a lifetime ago do give lord tyrion my best when you see him i was sorry when he died your father and i had our differences but he loved cat very much so did i she wasnt fond of you was she there have been few rulers in history well it appears she vastly underestimated you your father and brothers are gone yet here you stand king in the north last best hope against the coming storm you dont belong down here forgive me we havent ever talked properly i wanted to remedy that i have nothing to say to you not even thank you as cruel as the mad king if it werent for me youd have been slaughtered on that battlefield you have many enemies my king but i swear to you im not one of them i love sansa as i loved her mother touch my sister and ill kill you myself robert was neither mad nor cruel man ready  man ua ready man ua ready come on man yah  man ua come on under orders from the lord commander he simply had no interest in being

varys told me about a queen in the east who a boy in every port a boy a girl depends on the port could we get some more i thought it wasnt for you im developing a taste for it hes not your servant  its fine so youre going to be queen of the iron islands once i kill my uncle and what will you be handsome before i came to power you favored my brother whatever my queen commands hell be my advisor my protector oh i see your protector so if someone gets too close to you he might have to intervene to hold that person back until theyve made their intentions known why are you standing all the way over there then a foreign invasion is underway all your spies your little birds leave him be seems like you dont need a protector stay here   man were under attack euron did they tell you viserys was cruel stupid and weak you mothers below deck keep her safe would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion aah yah aah until your marriage to khal drogo your grace yah yah kill us get it over with randyll you ought to be a maester i knew nothing about you save your existence give your uncle a kiss euron little theon ah come on you cockless coward i have her come and get her and that you were said to be beautiful so you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the dothraki which you turned to your advantage who gave the order to kill me king robert who hired the assassins who sent word to essos to murder daenerys targaryen your grace i did what had to be done to  to keep yourself alive lord varys has proven himself a loyal servant spending your life reading about the achievements proven himself loyal quite the opposite if he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one what kind of a servant is that the kind the realm needs incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty as long as i have my eyes ill use them i wasnt born into a great house i came from nothing i was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering when i was a child i lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses ,4568
62,3,9.3,7,i wish you all the happiness in the world son of ned stark good if you dont mind my saying i dont think you should return to westeros im not sure youd be safe here oh i will return dear spider one last time  my lady i have to die in this strange country just like you missandei you stand in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen lets get them inside rightful heir to the iron throne rightful queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms the mother of dragons the khaleesi of the great grass sea the unburnt the breaker of chains this is jon snow hes king in the north thank you for traveling so far my lord i hope the seas werent too rough tyrion lannister for decades house lannister the winds were kind your grace apologies i have a flea bottom accent i know but jon snow is king in the north your grace hes not a lord  forgive me your grace this is ser davos seaworth forgive me ser davos i never did receive a formal education but i could have sworn i read the last king in the north was torrhen stark who bent the knee to my ancestor aegon targaryen has been the true power in westeros in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen torrhen stark swore fealty to house targaryen in perpetuity or do i have my facts wrong i wasnt there your grace no of course not but still an oath is an oath and perpetuity means what does perpetuity mean lord tyrion forever forever and the feat of that power is casterly rock so i assume my lord   youre here to bend the knee i am not oh well that is unfortunate youve traveled all this way to break faith with house targaryen break faith your father burned my grandfather alive he burned my uncle alive grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock he would have burned the seven kingdoms my father was an evil man on behalf of house targaryen i ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family and i ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father our two houses were allies for centuries and those were the best centuries the seven kingdoms have ever known and take it centuries of peace and prosperity with a targaryen sitting on the iron throne and a stark serving as warden of the north i am the last targaryen jon snow honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine bend the knee and i will name you warden of the north together we will save this country from those who would destroy it youre right youre not guilty of your fathers crimes summon jon snow and im not beholden to my ancestors vows then why are you here because i need your help and you need mine did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived i did and did you see the dothraki all of whom have sworn to kill for me theyre hard to miss but still i need your help  davos not to defeat cersei tyrion he would make a valuable ally you could storm kings landing tomorrow and the city would fall hell we almost took it and we didnt even have dragons almost  but you havent stormed kings landing why not the only reason i can see is you dont want to kill thousands of innocent people its the fastest way to win the war but you wont do it which means at the very least youre better than cersei melisandre let him stand before you and tell you the things still that doesnt explain why i need your help because right now you and i and cersei and everyone else were children playing at a game screaming that the rules arent fair you told me you liked this man  i do in the time since hes met me hes refused to call me queen hes refused to bow and now hes calling me a child i believe hes calling all of us children figure of speech your grace everyone you know will die before winters over if we dont defeat the enemy to the north jaime lannister myrcella   that have happened to him as far as i can see you are the enemy to the north i am not your enemy the dead are the enemy the dead is that another figure of speech the army of the dead is on the march the army of the dead you dont know me well my lord but do you think im a liar or a madman no i dont think youre either of those things dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass the army of the dead is real the white walkers are real the night king is real ive seen them if they get past the wall and were squabbling amongst ourselves were finished i was born at dragonstone not that i can remember it we fled before roberts assassins could find us robert was your fathers best friend no we can never hope to defeat the army of the dead alone i wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib not that it matters now of course i spent my life in foreign lands so many men have tried to kill me i dont remember all their names i have been sold like a broodmare ive been chained and betrayed raped and defiled do you know what kept me standing we need allies through all those years in exile faith not in any gods not in myths and legends in myself in daenerys targaryen the world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born the dothraki hadnt crossed the sea any sea they did for me youre abandoning your people youre abandoning your home i was born to rule the seven kingdoms and i will youll be ruling over a graveyard if we dont defeat the night king the war against my sister has already begun you cant expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting whatever you saw beyond the wall you dont believe him i understand that it sounds like nonsense until i return the north is yours but if destiny has brought daenerys targaryen back to our shores it has also made jon snow king in the north you were the first to bring dothraki to westeros he is the first to make allies of wildlings and northmen he was named lord commander of the nights watch he was named king in the north not because of his birthright he has no birthright hes a damn bastard all those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him all those things you dont believe in he faced those things he fought those things for the good of his people he risked his life for his people he took a knife in the heart for his people he gave his own if we dont put aside our enmities and band together we will die and then it doesnt matter whose skeleton sits on the iron throne if it doesnt matter then you might as well kneel the bastard of winterfell swear your allegiance to queen daenerys help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north theres no time for that theres no time for any of this while we stand here debating it takes no time to bend the knee pledge your sword to her cause and why would i do that i mean no offense your grace the dwarf of casterly rock but i dont know you as far as i can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your fathers name and my own father fought to overthrow the mad king the lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them and i will continue to do so as well as i can thats fair its also fair to point out that im the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms i believe we last saw each other atop the wall by declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom you are in open rebellion  your grace please dismiss your guests i have grave news you must forgive my manners youll both be tired after your long journey well have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms am i your prisoner myrcella you were pissing off the edge if i remember right not yet our ironborn and dornish allies were attacked en route to dorne and  two or three ships escaped the rest sunk or captured ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured the greyjoys dead or captured all of them pull  heave picked up some scars along the road pull your sisters dead euron has her you saw him take her but you got away  i couldnt save her i tried you wouldnt be here if you tried man come men its been a long road but were both still here sails up woman murderer man whores   traitor this is the life look at them cheering for a greyjoy i have to be honest im tyrion lannister this is making me hard did you see little theons face right before he jumped overboard oh no  what a twat man whore whore whore  man ua murderers davos seaworth  ah the onion knight my queen please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the iron islands i give you what no other man could give justice justice for your murdered daughter youve proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas and a true friend to the crown you deserve more than a true friend and you deserve a proper reward for your heroism we fought on opposite sides at the battle of blackwater bay theres only one reward i want you shall have what your heart desires when the war is won with euron greyjoy commanding our naval forces and jaime lannister leading our armies the sons and daughters of westeros shall defend our country theres nothing quite like it is there the love of the people unluckily for me though i suppose you wouldnt know this same mob spat at my sister not long ago and if you turn on us theyll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike or yours they just like severed heads really listen if you have any advice at all i would love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers advice missandei is the queens most trusted advisor does she like it gentle or rough a finger in the bum shh shh shh shh not now well talk later cersei i want you to know i understand even though were enemies you and i i understand the fury that drives you i was there that day when ser gregor crushed your lovers head if i close my eyes i can hear the sound of oberyns skull breaking   welcome to dragonstone the sound of your scream i never heard a sound like that i thought thats true love oberyn looked beautiful that day he really did no one moved like him no one had such skill with a spear even ser gregor couldnt stop him if only he hadnt taunted him he couldve walked away and left poor ser gregor to die but that wasnt your lovers way was it our queen knows it is a long journey now hes buried somewhere and heres ser gregor stronger than ever that must be difficult for you when my daughter was taken from me my only daughter well you cant imagine how that feels unless youve lost a child i fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse i couldnt bear to see her in another womans arms she appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf i never got to have a mother but myrcella did she was mine and you took her from me why did you do that doesnt matter now your daughters a beauty too those brown eyes those lips perfect dornish beauty i imagine shes your favorite if you wouldnt mind handing over your weapons i know i know were not supposed to have favorites but still were only human we love whom we love im sorry i cant understand you that gag makes it impossible to understand what youre saying it must be frustrating we all make our choices you chose to murder my daughter you must have felt powerful after you made that choice of course   do you feel powerful now i dont sleep very well not at all really i lie in bed and i stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies how to destroy ellaria sand the woman who murdered my only daughter i thought about having ser gregor crush your skull the way he did oberyns it would be poetic i suppose but fast too fast i thought about having him crush your daughters skull shes so beautiful the thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg no its just not right mama qyburn here is the cleverest man i know clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder myrcella please this way the long goodbye was that it the long farewell  thats the one how long does the poison take qyburn difficult to say hours days it depends on the subjects constitution but death is certain  oh yes your grace quite certain your daughter will die here in this cell and you will be here watching when she does youll be here the rest of your days if you refuse to eat well force food down your throat where are you from you will live to watch your daughter rot to watch that beautiful face collapse   to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices youve made make sure the guards change the torches every few hours i dont want her to miss a thing no i cant place the accent dont what are you doing no one can see us like this i am the queen of the seven kingdoms ill do as i please forgive me your grace the visitor from braavos has arrived good and well need fresh sheets for the bed at once your grace i was born on the island of naath no thank you my condolences your grace on the death of your son from all reports he was a fine young man the iron bank didnt send you here to offer condolences condolences and congratulations to become the first ruling queen of the seven kingdoms thats quite an accomplishment the iron bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements ah i hear its beautiful down there who sought to subvert the rule of law the destruction of the sept of baelor was a tragic accident indeed but sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership the iron bank wants its gold back your father never minced words either but yes your debts are considerable and youre now engaged in a conflict on several fronts we both know how expensive war can be and we both know gold wins wars palm trees and butterflies your vaults are empty your late husbands profligacy saw to that your wealthiest allies the tyrells are now your enemies you are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne and the iron bank wants to bet on a winner we dont make bets we invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful a fancy way of saying bet the wars already begun ive drawn first blood i decapitated the dornish snake kill us havent been myself my armada owns the narrow sea euron greyjoys armada owns the narrow sea euron greyjoy is loyal to me for now daenerys targaryen has three fullgrown dragons how well do wooden ships fare against firebreathing dragons her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think but lets talk about the targaryen girl you want to invest in her im guessing the iron bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade this place has changed how are your profits now that daenerys has freed all the slaves the slave trade has entered a downturn its true from what i gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary than a monarch in your experience how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries the lannisters owe the iron bank quite a lot of money but lannisters always pay their debts do former slaves or dothraki or dragons your fathers daughter indeed tyrion and sansa i hear shes alive and well give me a fortnight stay in kings landing as my honored guest and when you return to braavos i swear to you my debt will be paid in full i came down here to brood over my failure to predict the greyjoy attack youre making it difficult you look a lot better brooding than i do you make me feel like im failing at brooding over failing im a prisoner on this island i wouldnt say youre a prisoner on this island jon she is  does she miss me terribly youre free to walk the castle the beaches to go wherever you want except to my ship you took my ship i wouldnt say we took your ship im not playing word games with you the dead are coming for us all why dont you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies and ill figure out what to do about your walking dead men a sham marriage and unconsummated its hard for me to fathom it really is if someone told me about the white walkers and the night king you probably dont believe me i do actually you didnt before grumkins and snarks you called them do you remember you said it was all nonsense it was nonsense everybody knew it but then mormont saw them i didnt ask  well it was wasnt and you saw them and i trust the eyes of an honest man more than i trust what everybody knows how do i convince people who dont know me that an enemy they dont believe in is coming to kill them all good question  i know its a good question im looking for an answer peoples minds arent made for problems that large white walkers the night king army of the dead anyway its almost a relief to confront a comfortable familiar monster like my sister i need to help prepare my people for whats coming i cant help them from here id like to leave it seems unlikely that you became king in the north by giving up that easily everyone told me to learn from my fathers mistakes dont go south dont answer a summons from the mad kings daughter shes much smarter than she lets on a foreign invader and here i am a northern fool children are not their fathers luckily for all of us and sometimes theres more to foreign invaders and northern fools than meets the eye daenerys could have sailed for westeros long ago but she didnt instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates shes starting to let on some of whom are on this island with us right now while youre our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the mad kings daughter she protects people from monsters just as you do its why she came here and shes not about to head north to fight an enemy shes never seen on the word of a man she doesnt know good after a single meeting its not a reasonable thing to ask so do you have anything reasonable to ask what do you mean maybe you are a northern fool im asking if theres something i can do to help you dragonglass  tyrion yes volcanic glass obsidian he says you have a tremendous amount of it here why are we talking about glass i may have found a way to treat ser jorah tyrion at some point we just lost two of our allies which is why i was speaking to jon snow a potential ally and what does the king in the north want with dragonglass apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers or stop them destroy them unsure about the nomenclature and what do you think about this army of the dead and white walkers and night kings i want to hear how a nights watch recruit became king in the north id very much like to believe that jon snow is wrong but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it which wise man said this i dont remember are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom i would never do that to you the reason i believe jon snow is because hes here all of his advisors would have told him not to come as long as you tell me how a lannister i would have told him not to come and hes here anyway you dont have to believe him let him mine the dragonglass if hes wrong its worthless you didnt even know it was here its nothing to you give him something by giving him nothing take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally became hand to daenerys targaryen keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand casterly rock what was that ser davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people did you notice that you must allow them their flights of fancy its dreary in the north amazing thing to see i named them for my brothers viserys and rhaegar a long and bloody tale theyre both gone now you lost two brothers as well people thought dragons were gone forever but here they are perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know youve been talking to tyrion he is my hand he enjoys talking  we all enjoy what were good at i dont you know im not going to let cersei stay on the iron throne i never expected that you would to be honest i was drunk for most of it and i havent changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to that throne i havent either i will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it any resources or men you need i will provide for you thank you so you believe me then about the night king and the army of the dead youd better get to work jon snow my bannermen think im a fool for coming here how much do we have bushels my lady what does that mean for the current occupants of the castle its enough food for a year perhaps more and whats the longest winter in the past hundred years uh im not entirely certain iill check maester luwins records he kept a copy of every raven scroll youre telling me we dont have enough food of course they do especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend winterfell no my lady most likely not then we must prepare for that eventuality whatever direction the threat comes from this is the best place to be we need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north if we dont use it by winters end well give it back to them but if the entire north has to flee to winterfell they wont have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them if i was your hand i would have advised against it very wise my lady maester wolkan youll see to it are they covering those breastplates in leather no my lady well shouldnt they be once the real cold comes they should indeed pardon me my lady you there why isnt there leather on these command suits you the northerners are all facing north general rule of thumb worried about the threat from beyond the wall so they should be i know cersei better than anyone here if you turn your back on her you dont know cersei better than anyone here  i only meant to say that the woman who murdered my mother father and brother is dangerous thank you for your wise counsel one of two things will happen either the dead will defeat the living in which case please try not to scream stark men dont fare well when they travel south all our troubles come to an end or life will win out and what then dont fight in the north or the south fight every battle everywhere always in your mind everyone is your enemy everyone is your friend every possible series of events is happening all at once live that way and nothing will surprise you everything that happens will be something true that youve seen before lady sansa at the gate hello sansa i wish jon were here yes i need to speak to him youre fathers last living trueborn son youre lord of winterfell now i can never be lord of winterfell but im not a stark i can never be lord of anything im the threeeyed raven i dont know what that means its difficult to explain try please for me it means i can see everything everything thats ever happened to everyone everything thats happening right now its all pieces now fragments i need to learn to see better when the long night comes again i need to be ready how do you know all this the threeeyed raven taught me i thought you were the threeeyed raven i told you its difficult to explain bran im sorry for all thats happened to you im sorry it had to happen here in our home it was so beautiful that night snow falling just like now and you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress i have to go back inside bran ill stay a bit longer hmm hmm does it hurt id say you get used to them a bit less than before the infection no longer appears to be active unusual unlikely one could almost be forgiven for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent dont know anything about that i just started feeling better but you never really do i assumed it was the rest that did it and the climate the climate youre free to go ser this chamber is needed for the infectious which you are no longer tarly id like to speak with you in my study this evening how bad is it suppose ill find out this evening where will you go   come their mother is waiting for you i surrendered to this sickness the moment i first saw it i knew it would kill me or id kill myself before it could daenerys stormborn convinced me otherwise the only place for me is back with her i owe her my life her and you your father saved me more than once its the least i could do i wondered why you werent there to meet our guests perhaps our paths will cross again i hope they do ebrose you treated him  yes who told you to treat him no one who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him i seem to remember you but you treated him anyway  i did yes i forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful especially on someone of that age you begged us to summon the king in the north you could have infected yourself and others you could have devastated the entire citadel but you didnt its a meticulous difficult procedure many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed yet you succeeded how i read the books and followed the instructions that man is alive because of you dont you want to see him again you should be proud thank you archmaester come here all these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away i need you to make copies of them you were expecting a reward your reward is not being immediately expelled from the citadel youd better get started and careful of the paper mites they like flesh as well ive done my part we need to find euron greyjoys fleet and sink it your grace hes already destroyed a good portion of our fleet to send our remaining ships after him im not talking about sending our ships after him would you have to go yourself eurons ships could be anywhere or in more than one place youd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long i wouldnt be alone ive brought ice and fire together i would have drogon viserion and rhaegal what can anyone do to them missandei they can still do something to you it only takes one arrow its too great a risk youre too important what about casterly rock the unsullied will be there soon and what will they face a difficult situation they know were coming strange yes cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy house lannister she will be ready no one has ever taken the rock  man archers tyrion the lannister army is still the army my father built come on  tyrion welltrained and wellprovisioned men at least they will see us coming they will be ready you spoke so highly of jon snow man draw loose  man ua loose tyrion the gates of casterly rock are impregnable the fight up the walls will be hard we will be at a disadvantage   many men will die just as my father said they would interesting thing about my father he built our house up from near ruin he built our army he built casterly rock as we know it but when he arrives you hide on a cliff but he didnt build the sewers that was beneath him so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find me he was right i was low the company i kept low women mostly they werent welcome at the rock father disapproved of that sort of behavior couldnt walk them through the front gates i didnt take you for a bashful girl i couldnt have them in my chambers so in the process of building the sewers i threw in something for myself it was a passage that began in an out of the way cove by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers no better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground casterly rock is an impregnable fortress but as a good friend of mine once said my time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end give me  good men and ill impregnate the bitch and so it begins they will face the bulk of the lannister forces they will be outnumbered they will have less armor and fewer weapons but my sisters armies fight for her out of fear the unsullied will be fighting for something greater they will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them oh i doubt that they will be fighting for you and that is why they will triumph where are they where are the rest of the lannisters give us common folk one taste of power its done  it is and now the rains weep oer our halls did we fight well uh as well as could be expected it was never our forte golden roses indeed your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending casterly rock the truth is casterly rock isnt worth much anymore well it is to me meera reed this is brandon stark were like the lion who tasted man but my fond childhood memories wont keep cersei on the throne so you just let them take it for now they wont be able to hold it euron greyjoys navy burned their ships we emptied the larders before we left eventually theyll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across westeros and you took your army your real army and went where they werent nothing is ever so sweet again as robb stark did to me at whispering wood there are always lessons in failures yes you must be very wise by now my father always said i was a slow learner if he was so clever why didnt he take highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry i suppose ill be able to ask him myself soon enough no more learning from my mistakes eh neither of us is common folk anymore how will you do it with that sword that was joffreys sword wasnt it not that he ever used it what did he call it widows wail he really was a cunt wasnt he i did unspeakable things to protect my family or watched them being done on my orders i never lost a nights sleep over them i did not part on good terms they were necessary and whatever i imagined necessary for the safety of house tyrell i did but your sister has done things i was incapable of imagining that was my prize mistake a failure of imagination shes a monster you do know that to you im sure to others as well with the king in the north or his advisor but after weve won and theres no one left to oppose us when people are living peacefully in the world she built do you really think theyll wring their hands over the way she built it you love her you really do love her you poor fool shell be the end of you possibly not much to be gained from discussing it with you though is there why what better person to discuss it with what better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room but perhaps youre right if shes driven you this far its gone beyond your control yes it has shes a disease i regret my role in spreading it because of mistakes i made you will too i think were done here how will it happen cersei had several ideas whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the red keep flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of kings landing i talked her out of those will there be pain no i made sure of that terrible mistakes thats good id hate to die like your son clawing at my neck foam and bile spilling from my mouth eyes bloodred skin purple must have been horrible for you as a kingsguard as a father it was horrible enough for me a shocking scene not at all what i intended i would only be a distraction if i stayed you see i had never seen the poison work before tell cersei i want her to know it was me so where will you go  volantis ,5981
63,4,9.8,7,randyll tarly she has three fullgrown dragons your grace we must devise a way to raise their spirits yes perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture my only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it i see a great deal of potential in that venture i imagine it would require outside investment it will indeed i need to expand my armies my navies how do you propose to stop them my hand qyburn has made overtures to the golden company in essos i know them well they have helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears thats good to hear i too would like them to recover some things that belong to me rest assured your grace you can count on the iron banks support hmm  as soon as the gold arrives we are currently at work on a solution littlefinger this is for you the last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat but your mother fought him off the other dagger the one that took her life i would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if i could have i wasnt there for her when she needed me most but i am here for her now to do what she would have done to protect her children anything i can do for you brandon you need only ask do you know who this belonged to no that very question was what started the war of the five kings in a way that dagger made you what you are today forced from your home driven out to the wilds beyond the wall i imagine youve seen things most men wouldnt believe to go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world i can only imagine chaos is a ladder im sorry to have disturbed you lord stark im not lord stark whats that maester wolkan built it for me hot pie i thought youd be heading for winterfell so i can move around more easily its a very good idea youre leaving i dont want to leave you but when when they come i need to be with my family and youre safe well as safe as anyone can be now you dont need me anymore no i dont jon snow came down from castle black thats all youve got to say thank you thank you for helping me my brother died for you hodor and summer died for you i almost died for you bran  im not really not anymore with a wildling army and won the battle of the bastards i remember what it felt like to be brandon stark but i remember so much else now you died in that cave i did the kitchen girl the redhead with the behind the only thing in the kitchen that youve put your cock in is the liver ey up where you going in there i live here  fuck off im arya stark this

she comes in asking for uh ser rodrick rodrick yeah luwin yeah  and maester luwin  and dont trouble yourself over it my lady well well find her  you dont have to i know where she is i couldnt save her i tried do i have to call you lady stark now yes you shouldnt have run from the guards i didnt run you need better guards it suits you lady stark jon left you in charge he did i hope he comes back soon you wouldnt be here if youd tried i remember how happy he was to see me when he sees you his heart will probably stop it doesnt look like him shouldve been carved by someone who knew his face everyone who knew his face is dead were not they say you killed joffrey did you i wish i had what about casterly rock hmm me too i was angry when i heard someone else had done it however long my list got he was always first your list of people im going to kill how did you get back to winterfell its a long story i imagine yours is too yes not a very pleasant one mine neither but our stories arent over yet no theyre not arya brans home too you came home i saw you at the crossroads you saw me i see quite a lot now bran has visions i thought you might go to kings landing so did i why would you go back there cerseis on her list of names who else is on your list most of them are dead already where did you get this littlefinger gave it to me littlefinger hes here tycho nestoris we both know how expensive war can be he has declared for house stark why would he give you a dagger he thought id want it  sansa why because it was meant to kill me the cutthroat after your fall why would a cutthroat have a valyrian steel dagger someone very wealthy wanted me dead hes not a generous man he wouldnt give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back your vaults are empty it doesnt matter  what do you mean it doesnt matter i dont want it are you sure arya its valyrian steel its wasted on a cripple catelyn stark would be proud you kept your vow i did next to nothing my debt will be paid in full youre too hard on yourself my lady im not a thank you podrick your grace theres still no word from the unsullied soon he will come back to you hed better what happened to whom how will it happen many things many things   jon your grace i wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits well this is it all well ever need there is something else i want to show you your grace the children of the forest made these will there be pain when a very long time ago they were right here standing where were standing before there were targaryens or starks or lannisters maybe even before there were men no they were here together the children and the first men doing what fighting each other they fought together against their common enemy jaime no ill make sure of that despite their differences despite their suspicions together we need to do the same if were going to survive because the enemy is real its always been real and you say you cant defeat them without my armies and my dragons no i dont think i can i will fight for you i will fight for the north id hate to die like your son when you bend the knee my people wont accept a southern ruler not after everything theyve suffered they will if their king does they chose you to lead them they chose you to protect them isnt their survival more important than your pride what is it we took casterly rock not at all what i intended thats very good to hear isnt it youll want to discuss this amongst yourselves perhaps  you will stay all my allies are gone theyve been taken from me while ive been sitting here on this island you still have the largest armies  who wont be able to eat because cersei has taken all the food from the reach tyrion call grey worm and the unsullied back we still have enough ships to carry the dothraki to the mainland tell cersei commit to the blockade of kings landing we have a plan its still the right plan  the right plan your strategy has lost us dorne the iron islands and the reach if i have underestimated our enemies  our enemies your family you mean perhaps you dont want to hurt them after all enough with the clever plans i have three large dragons im going to fly them to the red keep i want her to know it was me weve discussed this my enemies are in the red keep what kind of a queen am i if im not willing to risk my life to fight them a smart one what do you think i should do i would never presume to  im at war im losing what do you think i should do jon i never thought that dragons would exist again no one did the people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen build a world thats different from the shit one theyve always known but if you use them to melt castles and burn cities youre not different youre just more of the same   dont lunge dont go where your enemy leads you brienne up and dont  dont fight someone like her in the first place nice sword very nice dagger if they havent contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then im afraid theyll have to make due with what theyve brought man hold that wagon we cant its been a while since i trained i can go and find the master of arms for you my lady he didnt beat the hound you did i want to train with you you swore to serve both my mothers daughters didnt you brienne move aside podrick you cant use that my lady its too small tyrion lannister i wont cut you dont worry ill try not to who taught you how to do that no one youve just won the biggest prize in the world davos what do you think of her  who  i believe you know of whom i speak i think she has a good heart a good heart ive noticed you staring at her good heart theres no time for that i saw the night king davos i looked into his eyes how many men do we have in the north to fight him less what could you possibly have to be upset about fewer  what speaking of good hearts missandei of naath ser davos lord snow king snow isnt it no that doesnt sound right king jon  it doesnt matter forgive me but may i ask a question of course your name is jon snow but your fathers name was ned stark im a bastard come on you can tell me my mother and father werent married is the custom different in naath we dont have marriage in naath so the concept of a bastard doesnt exist that sounds liberating why did you leave your homeland i was stolen away by slavers im sorry if i may how did a slave girl come to advise daenerys targaryen queen of thorns give you one last prick in the balls she bought me from my master and set me free davos that was good of her of course youre serving her now arent you i serve my queen because i want to serve my queen because i believe in her and if you wanted to sail home to naath tomorrow then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune you believe that i know it all of us who came with her from essos before saying goodbye we believe in her shes not our queen because shes the daughter of some king we never knew shes the queen we chose will you forgive me if i switch sides jon is that a greyjoy ship man halt ill save my confessions for the high septon jon i didnt know you were here ssansa is she all right what you did for her is the only reason im not killing you we heard your uncle attacked your fleet we thought you were dead i should be davos your sister there is no

kingdoms i will allow you to mine the dragonglass will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you yes im sure queen cerseis reign will be quiet and peaceable ah stranger things have happened like what the granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons my lord the current harvest  we have teams of men collecting it from all the farms in the reach ser bronn will you accompany the tarlys and forge weapons from it and help them accelerate this process im not much for shoveling wheat no but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest i bet youre going to have a real talent for that my lord my lord my lord tycho i must say i dont think the iron bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment i always considered your father a very effective and efficient man thank you but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely youre too kind my lord i am neither kind nor a lord your grace i am merely an instrument of the institution i represent its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic not sentiment and the current arithmetic is outstanding uh the gold  is on its way my brother is supervising its transportation himself some at the iron bank will be disappointed theyve grown rather fond of your interest payments ,3052

armies that win wars we have the tyrell gold we have the iron bank behind us we can buy mercenaries not the same as our men but theyll fight if theyre well paid which they will be i just saw the dothraki fight theyll beat any mercenary army theyll beat any army ive ever seen killing our men wasnt war for them it was sport jon left you in charge  he did her dragon burnt a thousand wagons qyburns scorpion fired bolts bigger than you they couldnt stop it and she has three of them this isnt a war we can win so what do we do sue for peace i sit on her fathers throne the father you betrayed and murdered and in her mind shes winning what sort of offer do you think shed make maybe we can count on tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and son he didnt you saw the crossbow you saw his body im not talking about father tyrion didnt kill joffrey he had nothing to do with it after all this time it still amazes me that you  it was olenna she confessed before she died and this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her jaime lannister lord tarly  i believe you know my son after and you believed her if you were olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to joffrey or tommen which one would margaery have been better able to control which one would have made olenna the true ruler of the seven kingdoms she was telling the truth i shouldnt have listened to you she should have died screaming do you fight with us shes dead like her son her grandchildren her whole house and if we dont find a way out of this war well follow them so we fight and die or we submit and die i know my choice a soldier should know his or with the fallen savages and eunuchs theyre beautiful arent they it wasnt the word i was thinking of but but yes they are gorgeous beasts theyre not beasts to me no matter how big they get or how terrifying to everyone else theyre my children daenerys targaryen what do you think i should do you werent gone long no and and i have fewer enemies today than i did yesterday youre not sure how you feel about that no im not how many men did your army kill taking winterfell back from the boltons thousands we both want to help people what do you see if you use them to melt castles and burn cities we can only help them from a position of strength sometimes strength is terrible when you first came here ser davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people ser davos gets carried away so it was a figure of speech your grace jon snow this is ser jorah mormont youre not different an old friend i served with your father he was a great man you look strong you found a cure i wouldnt be here if i hadnt i return to your service my queen if youll have me it would be my honor youre just more of the same ravens we need to send ravens i put very little stock in it myself prophecies of doom are never in short supply especially when winter comes i remember wolkan a little timid but a sharp mind sandhu eh the north has dulled many good maesters wits man listen hard to say whether its the cold the drink or the company   sandhu a crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes ebrose yes it is a bit much still we ought to write back  sam brandon stark the crippled boy  do you know him i led him through the wall years ago i saw him go beyond the wall and somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could not the nights watch not the wildlings no one perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind i sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming everyone in westeros trusts and respects you if you tell people the threat is real theyll believe it if you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall theyll do it and if you tell every maester in the citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night they may find something that lets us defeat the army of the dead for good it could be done and this news could be authentic its possible its also possible that this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest sandhu that does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples archmaester please its real ive seen it we will write to maester wolkan at winterfell for clarification i promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another archmaester please  that will be all tarly maester it brings to mind the work of jenny of oldstones the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest   sandhu dont forget the prophet lodos who promised that the drowned god would rise up and destroy aegon the conqueror   ah lodos is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive im afraid so horrible business i havent had the heart to tell him yet hes a good lad right the ravenry was falling apart the last time i checked all rulers demand that people bend the knee thats why theyre rulers she gave tarly a choice a man who had taken up arms against her what else could she do not burn him alive alongside his son i am her hand not her head i cant make her decisions for her thats what i used to tell myself about her father i found the traitors but i wasnt the one burning them alive i was only a purveyor of information its what i told myself when i watched them beg for mercy im not the one doing it when the pitch of their screams rose higher the hound a wall of ice im not the one doing it when their hair caught fire and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room im not the one doing it daenerys is not her father and she never will be with the right counsel you need to find a way to make her listen whos that for  jon snow did you read it its a sealed scroll for the king in the north whats it say nothing good i thought arya was dead i thought bran was dead im happy for you you dont look happy bran saw the night king and his army marching towards eastwatch if they make it past the wall the wall has kept them out for thousands of years presumably i need to go home you said you dont have enough men well fight with the men we have unless youll join us and give the country to cersei as soon as i march away she marches in perhaps not cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story you couldve killed me made up by wet nurses to frighten children what if we prove her wrong i dont think shell come see the dead at my invitation so bring the dead to her i thought that was what we were trying to avoid we dont have to bring the whole army only one soldier is that possible the first wight i ever saw was brought into castle black from beyond the wall the fuck were you doing back there bring one of these things down to kings landing and show her the truth anything you bring back will be useless unless cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital the only person she listens to is jaime he might listen to me and how would you get into kings landing i can smuggle you in ending the war but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you im warning you im not a fighter well it will all be for nothing if we dont have one of these dead men fair point how do you propose to find one with the queens permission ill go north and take one you asked me to find a cure so i could serve you allow me to serve you the free folk will help us killing her they know the real north better than anyone they wont follow ser jorah they wont have to you cant lead a raid beyond the wall youre not in the nights watch anymore youre king in the north im the only one here whos fought them im the only one here who knows them i havent given you permission to leave with respect your grace i dont need your permission i am a king you saw the dragon between you and her and i came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive i put my trust in you a stranger because i knew it was the best chance for my people for all our people now im asking you to trust in a stranger because its our best chance glover the king in the north should stay in the north and   we did not choose you to rule us my lady but perhaps we should have   the knights of the vale came here for you lady stark men aye you are very kind my lords but jon is our king he is doing what he thinks is best sansa i warned jon this would happen that he couldnt leave the north listen to me cunt and expect it to just sit and wait for him like ghost he didnt he trusted you to hold it for him well hes not making it easy the northern lords are proud these are mother and fathers chambers and nothing dont do that what  say what you mean you always liked nice things they made you feel better than everyone the wall till i get what im owed are you angry with me they were insulting jon and you sat there and listened i listened to their complaints which is my responsibility as lady of winterfell their opinions are important to you glover has  men royce has offend them and jon loses his army not if they lose their heads first winterfell didnt just fall into our hands a dragon doesnt get to kill you we took it back and the mormonts and the hornwoods and the wildlings and the vale all of us working together now im sure cutting off heads is very satisfying but thats not the way you get people to work together and if jon doesnt come back youll need their support so you can work together to give you what you really want you dont get to kill you how can you even think such a horrible thing youre thinking it right now you dont want to be but the thought just wont go away i have work to do my lady last time i was here i killed my father with a crossbow last time i was here you killed my son with wildfire theres a path to the left that hugs the cliff only i get to kill you the guards hardly ever patrol it too many steps youre not staying here ive got my own business in flea bottom what if someone takes the boat then were fucked best hurry we dont have time for this we should be preparing the city for a siege the dothraki are coming all the more reason for you to train that was only one of them unless you plan on fighting dothraki yearolds well i seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well and here i am ready to train why down here i dont think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet today might be the day i kill you by accident oh you wont be swinging it at me ill leave you to it i needed to see you she has two more and i knew youd never agree to meet you made me look like a complete fool i thought id surprise you by hitting casterly rock but you were three steps ahead of me abandoned the family home completely unsentimental father would have been proud dont talk about father  listen to me i once told bronn that if i ever saw you again id cut you in half itll take you a while with a sparring sword if she decides to use them to really use them he was going to execute me he knew i was innocent he didnt hate me because of anything i did he hated me because of what i am a little monster sent to punish him did he did he think did he think i wanted to be born this way did he think i chose it  what do you want daenerys will win this war youre a military man youre fucked  dont you mean were fucked you must know theres no way around that daenerys is not her father shes even willing to suspend the hostilities if cersei agrees to certain terms if you want cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself i i dont and daenerys doesnt not right now anyway she has a more important request no i do not i wasnt sure id find you thought you might still be rowing i looked in shops taverns brothels should have known to come straight to the street of steel arent you worried about the gold cloaks havent been here in years why should they recognize me sometimes i hardly do nothing fucks you harder than time dragons are where our partnership ends anybody give you any trouble here i am arming lannisters and i never get a second look but you were right safest place for me was right under the queens nose dont be so sure safety is never a permanent state of affairs bad things are coming you came to get me you want me to come with you well the thing you need to understand is  im ready the only thing standing between us im not gonna be around when those things you  lets go you should know what youre heading into what do you think ive been thinking about with every swing of the hammer how happy i am making weapons for the family that killed my father the family that tried to kill me ive been getting ready i never knew what for start spitting fire on kings landing but ive always known id know it when it comes you might want to bring one of those swords i dont know much about swinging swords but this this i know keep your fathers name to yourself situations complicated enough already well who should i say i am i told you clovis if we dont get out of here soon someones going to  gold cloak you there i have to tell cersei no weapons friends i promise what can i do for you is that your boat  it is gold cloak the docks are that way  davos that they are i try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves still five gold dragons   are you joking you must be even older than you look apiece may as well jump back in that river i cant say it was a pleasure doing business with you gold cloak ua whats in the boat not more gold wine  mm i like wine  or hams come have a look fermented crab  what davos fermented crab one bucket of this triples a brothels earnings for the week a man thinks hes done hes ready to go back to his loving family but before he gets his breeches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth five minutes later hes back in the race here have a taste id hurry to your favorite establishment or youll put a hole in that chainmail oi dwarf i really wouldnt try any more until you see how the first bite hits you that dwarf whered you get that scar fish hook some men you just cant teach we was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back davos perhaps theres some arrangement arrangement you gonna arrange to pay us more than queen cersei   this is gendry hell do go go go qyburn i could give you something that wont be necessary ser jaime   why was qyburn here hes the hand of the queen why are you here i met with tyrion what did our brother have to say daenerys wants to meet to discuss her surrender to discuss an armistice shes just won a great victory why would she want a truce now because an army of dead men is marching on the seven kingdoms tyrion claims hell have proof i know what cersei has told you are you going to punish him  tyrion bronn he betrayed you he set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing you let it happen why ive come to believe that an accommodation with the dragon queen could be in our immediate interest that ive come to destroy your cities she has the numbers if we want to beat her we have to be clever we have to fight her like father would have dead men dragons and dragon queens whatever stands in our way we will defeat it for ourselves for our house for this who will you say is the father you people wont like that and the army of the dead is the wall burn down your homes do you remember what father used to say about people the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep never betray me again davos were leaving today the kings got a lot on his mind  i understand he doesnt need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king you dont have to worry  youre just clovis a smith whos come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the winterfell forges understood murder you and orphan your children begging your pardon your grace you survived kings landing yet again your grace this is clo names gendry your grace im robert baratheons son bastard son he was meant to keep that to himself our fathers trusted each other why shouldnt we thats cersei lannister not me i saw your father once at winterfell i met yours in my shop youre a lot leaner  and youre a lot shorter i grew up on stories about them all i ever knew is that they fought together and won ser davos told me where youre going your grace and why let me come with you dont be a fool youre not a soldier no but im a fighter and he wont be needing a smith with a sword like that im not here to murder you know how to use one well thats a problem i prefer a hammer he can handle himself we could use the help as my father used to say its better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life i owe you my life twice over and all i want to destroy but if what you said is true about whats up there i cant wait out this war yeah nobody mind me all ive ever done is live to a ripe old age man all right come on tyrion you may not believe it but ive missed you mormont nobody glowers quite like you not even grey worm is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor this is the coin the slaver gave me when i suggested he free us and pay us remember it was supposed to last us the rest of our lives take it with you but bring it back our queen needs you we should be better at saying farewell by now your grace i if i dont return at least you wont have to deal with the king in the north anymore to the benefit of no one but the cersei lannisters of the world ive grown used to him i wish you good fortune in the wars to come your grace heave gilly do you know how many steps there are in the citadel no guess how many windows are in the great sept of baelor none anymore thats true i offer you a choice this high septon maynard he recorded everything he even recorded his own bowel movements what does annulment mean its when a man sets aside his lawful wife maynard says here that he issued an annulment for a prince ragger and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in dorne is that a common thing in the south or these maesters they set me to the task of preserving that mans window counting bend the knee and join me and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the night kings probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored but thats all right isnt it we can all become slavering murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of high septon maynards  shits steps that number was the steps together we will leave the world a better place than we found it are you sure you want to do this you always wanted to be a maester im tired of reading about the achievements of better men wolkan i found it my lord it uh took some searching maester luwins archives are very thorough youre sure this is the only copy in winterfell and the wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries or refuse uh yes my lord lady stark thanks you for your service tormund isnt it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this ive been failing at that job of late how many queens are there now two and you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother and die both how many men did you bring jon not enough the big woman we were hoping some of your men could help hmm  ill be staying behind im a liability out there as you well know you are you really want to go out there again youre not the only ones my scouts found them a mile south of the wall said they were on their way here youre the hound i saw you once at winterfell they want to go beyond the wall too we dont want to go beyond the wall we have to our lord told us that the great war is coming gendry dont trust him dont trust any of them theyre the brotherhood and the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a red witch to be murdered jorah thoros i hardly recognized you ser jorah mormont they wont give me anything to drink down here i havent been feeling like myself tormund youre a fucking mormont like the last lord commander step forward my lord he was my father he hunted us like animals you returned the favor as i recall here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason our reasons arent your reasons it doesnt matter what we think our reasons are you will not kneel theres a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not we may take the steps but the lord of light for fucks sake will you shut your hole are we coming with you or not dont you want to know what were doing is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die hes right were all on the same side i already have a queen how can we be were all breathing tyrion my sister she wasnt your queen until recently though was she last time we saw the night king when she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed house tyrell for all time so it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible there are no easy choices in war say what you will about your sister she was born in westeros shes lived here all her life you on the other hand murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader it was at hardhome one with no ties to this land with an army of savages at her back you will not trade your honor for your life i respect that perhaps he could take the black your grace whatever else he is he is a true soldier hed be invaluable at the wall you cannot send me to the wall you are not my queen you will have to kill me too ,4527
65,6,9.2,7,lord varys your father has proved to be an awful traitor your father wanted to execute me you know i heard he was in the right of course didnt make me hate him any less im glad he didnt catch you  me too your father gave me this sword changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf but its still longclaw lord commander mormont thought youd never come back to westeros tyrion lannister daenerys is not her father but you are back and its been in your family for centuries its not right for me to have it he gave it to you im not his son i brought shame onto my house i broke my fathers heart i forfeited the right to claim this sword its yours may it serve you well varys and she never will be with the right counsel and your children after you father used to watch us from up here he wouldnt say much you probably dont remember you were inside knitting all the time i remember one time the boys were shooting arrows with ser rodrik i came out here after i am her hand not her head and bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground ser rodrik would have cuffed him if he saw there was one arrow in the target there was no one around just like now no one to stop me so i started shooting and every shot i had to go up there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again i wasnt very good i cant make her decisions for her finally i hit the bullseye could have been the th shot or the th i dont remember but i hit the bullseye and i heard this i looked up and hes standing right here smiling down at me i knew what i was doing was against the rules but he was smiling so i knew it wasnt wrong the rules were wrong you need to find a way to make her listen i was doing what i was meant to be doing and he knew it now hes dead killed by the lannisters with your help what thats your pretty handwriting septa mordane used to crack my knuckles cause i couldnt write as well as you robb i write to you today with heavy heart our good king robert is dead jeor mormont its called longclaw it was my fathers sword killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt you dont have to read it i remember father has been charged with treason he conspired with roberts brothers against my beloved joffrey and tried to steal his throne the lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort i beg you come to kings landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses it was meant for my son jorah of lannister and stark your faithful sister sansa they forced me to do it did they with a knife at your throat did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop you dont know what it was like i was a child so was i i would have let them kill me before i betrayed my family they told me it was the only way to save father he brought dishonor to our house and you were stupid enough to believe them i remember you standing on that platform with joffrey and cersei when they dragged father to the block i remember the pretty dress you were wearing i remember the fancy way you did your hair you were there i was there standing in the crowd near baelors statue and what did you do did you come running to the rescue but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled did you fight off the lannisters and save father i wanted to  but you didnt just like me i didnt betray him i didnt betray robb i didnt betray our entire family for my beloved joffrey you should be on your knees thanking me were standing in winterfell again because of me you didnt win it back jon didnt win it back he lost the battle of the bastards the knights of the vale won the battle and they rode north for me the girl is innocent she should be given a chance from westeros while you were off where traveling the world i was training  training well while you were training i suffered things you could never imagine oh i dont know about that i can imagine quite a lot you never would have survived what i survived i guess well never know what are you going to do with that letter i dont know yet who did you show it to where did you find it clegane look into the flames what do you see youre scared arent you what are you scared of you didnt commit any crimes no ones going to hang you  well arya youre scared ill show it to jon and hell be angry no thats not jon hell understand you were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked lannisters do you know how happy cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting this is exactly what she wants this is what shes always wanted to tear us apart youre scared the northern lords will read it they wouldnt think much of lady sansa if they knew how she did cerseis bidding what would little lyanna mormont say shes younger than you were when you wrote this are you going to say but i was just a child youre angry sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things theres a mountain looks like an arrowhead ill go with anger youre the one they call the dog fuck off   they told me you were mean were you born mean or you just hate wildings i dont give two shits about wildings its gingers i hate gingers are beautiful we are kissed by fire just like you dont point your fucking finger at me the dead are marching past thousands of em did you trip into the fire when you were a baby i didnt trip i was pushed and ever since youve been mean will you fuck off i dont think youre truly mean you have sad eyes you want to suck my dick is that it dick  cock ah dick i like it tyrion cersei thinks the army of the dead i bet you do nope its pussy for me i have a beauty waiting for me back at winterfell if i ever get back there yellow hair blue eyes the tallest woman youve ever seen almost as tall as you brienne of tarth  you know her youre with brienne of fucking tarth well not with her yet is nothing but a story but i see the way she looks at me  how does she look at you like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver you do know her weve met i want to make babies with her think of them great big monsters theyd conquer the world how did a mad fucker like you live this long im good at killing people you dont look much like him what if we prove her wrong bring one of these things whos that your father i suppose you favor your mother you knew him course i did when he was hand he sent me off hunting for the mountain your wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back thoros has brought me back six times down to kings landing and show her the truth we both serve the same lord i serve the north the north didnt raise you from the dead the lord of light never spoke to me i dont know anything about him i dont know what he wants from me he wants you alive  why i dont know thats all anyone can tell me i dont know so whats the point in serving a god jon snow were all on the same side if none of us knows what he wants i think about that all the time i dont think its our purpose to understand except one thing were soldiers we have to know what were fighting for im not fighting so some man or woman i barely know can sit on a throne made of swords so what are you fighting for life death is the enemy to prove her loyalty were all breathin the first enemy and the last but we all die the enemy always wins and we still need to fight him thats all i know you and i wont find much joy while were here but we can keep others alive we can defend those who cant defend themselves i am the shield that guards the realms of men maybe we dont need to understand any more than that maybe thats enough aye maybe thats enough thats what i saw in the fire a mountain like an arrowhead thoros are you sure were getting close daenerys do you know what i like about you i honestly dont  youre not a hero oh well ive been heroic on occasion i once charged through the mud gate of kings landing and i dont want you to be a hero heroes do stupid things and they die drogo jorah daario even this jon snow they all try to outdo each other who can do the stupidest bravest thing its interesting these heroes you name drogo jorah daario you all right  mm even this jon snow they all fell in love with you jon snows not in love with me  oh my mistake i suppose he stares at you longingly because hes hopeful for a successful military alliance hes too little for me i didnt mean as heroes go he is quite little i know youre brave i wouldnt have chosen a coward as my hand ever been north before so if all goes well ill finally get to meet your sister from everything youve told me about her shed rather murder me than speak with me oh first shed torture you in some horrible way then shed murder you nobody trusts my sister less than i do believe me but if we go to the capital well go with two armies well go with three dragons anyone touches you kings landing burns down to the foundation stones never seen snow before and right now shes thinking of how to set a trap of course she is and shes wondering what trap youre laying for her are we laying any traps if we want to create a new and better world im not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start which war was won without deceit and mass murder yes youll need to be ruthless if youre going to win the throne beautiful eh you need to inspire a degree of fear but fear is all cersei has its all my father had and joffrey it makes their power brittle because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead aegon targaryen got quite a long way on fear he did but you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel aegon built a wheel if thats the kind of queen you want to be i can breathe again how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you so we walk into the lions den my brother promised me hed keep a grip on the lannister forces forgive me but i dont care about any lannister promises except yours and i promised him id keep you from doing anything impulsive impulsive this will be a difficult negotiation down south the air smells like pig shit were sitting down with people who want to see us both headless my sister is likely to say something provocative and  and you have been known to lose your temper from time to time as all great leaders do when have i lost my temper burning the tarlys for instance that was not impulsive that was necessary perhaps  perhaps youve never been down south perhaps the father needed to die and not the son perhaps they both needed time to contemplate their mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell we had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities one could be forgiven for thinking youre taking your familys side in this debate i am taking their side you need to take your enemys side if youre going to see things the way they do cersei lannister you must write to lady catelyn ive been to winterfell  thats the north and you need to see things the way they do if youre going to anticipate their actions respond effectively and beat them which i want you to do very much because i believe in you and in the world you want to build but the world you want to build doesnt get built all at once probably not in a single lifetime how do we ensure that your vision endures after you break the wheel how do we make sure it stays broken you want to know who sits on the iron throne after im dead is that it you say you cant have children but there are other ways of choosing a successor the nights watch has one method the ironborn for all their many flaws have another we will discuss the succession after i wear the crown your grace i saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on the blackwater rush and i saw hundreds of arrows miss gendry how do you live up here but any one of them could have found your heart and ended your youve been thinking about my death quite a bit havent you is this one of the items you discussed with your brother in kings landing im trying to serve you by planning for the long term perhaps if you planned for the short term we wouldnt have lost dorne and highgarden we will discuss the succession after i wear the crown how do you keep your balls from freezing off look the hound a bear big fucker do bears have blue eyes tormund you got to keep moving thats the secret we have to get him back to eastwatch walkings good fightings better fuckings best flask go on you all right i just got bit by a dead bear aye you did funny old life right then were off theres not a living woman within a hundred miles of here where did she get it  i dont know she seems very resourceful youre worried were asking  men to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen the weather will be the least of their problems many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home you question their loyalty  their loyalty is to jon jon is not here i havent heard from him in weeks youre the lady of winterfell we have to make do with what weve got the king chose you to rule in his absence and rule you have wisely ably they see that they respect you some may even prefer you yes they turned their backs on jon when it was time to retake winterfell then they named him their king and now theyre ready to turn their backs on him again how far would you trust men like that this one is maybe not so smart theyre all bloody wind vanes if they found out that i wrote that letter a woman whos already married not one but two enemies of her house by the time jon comes back hell have no army left aryas not like them shes your sister you may have disagreements but she would never betray her family she would if she thought i was going to betray jon davos says hes a strong fighter is that what she thinks i dont know what she thinks i dont know her anymore perhaps lady brienne could help shes sworn to protect both of catelyn starks girls is she not she is and if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way wouldnt she be honor bound to intercede she would if you would help your father urge your brother good thats more important than being smart something ive always wanted to know  all right how drunk were you when you charged through the breach on pyke if im being honest i dont remember charging through the breach some of the lads told me about it the next morning sounded like a good scrap aye it was a proper scrap the ironborn thought you were some kind of god the way you were waving that flaming sword i thought you were the bravest man i ever saw smart people dont come up here looking for the dead just the drunkest wheres the rest of them if we wait long enough well find out tormund so you met this dragon queen huh run back to eastwatch get a raven to daenerys tell her whats happened and im not leaving you  youre the fastest go now youre faster

me theyre not here now what are these my faces where did you get them in braavos while i was training to be a faceless man what does that mean back in braavos before i got my first face there was a game i used to play she needed your blood the game of faces its simple i ask you a question about yourself and you try to make lies sound like the truth if you fool me you win if i catch a lie you lose lets play i dont want to play how do you feel about jon being king is there someone else you think should rule the north instead of him yes thank you i know that those faces what are they you want to do the asking are you sure the game of faces didnt turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions tell me what they are we both wanted to be other people when we were younger you wanted to be a queen to sit next to a handsome young king on the iron throne i wanted to be a knight could have been worse  she wanted to kill me to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle neither of us got to be that other person did we the world doesnt just let girls decide what theyre going to be but i can now with the faces i can choose i can become someone else speak in their voice live in their skin i could even become you i wonder what it would feel like they would have killed me if wasnt for davos  but they didnt did they to wear those pretty dresses to be the lady of winterfell all id need to find out is your face im sorry im so sorry i wish i could take it back i wish wed never gone i dont so what you whinging about if we hadnt gone i wouldnt have seen you have to see it to know now i know the dragons are my children theyre the only children ill ever have do you understand we are going to destroy the night king and his army and well do it together you have my word thank you dany im not whinging dany who was the last person who called me that im not sure was it my brother mm not the company you want to keep all right not dany how about my queen id uh bend the knee but what about those who swore allegiance to you your lips are moving and youre complaining about something theyll all come to see you for what you are i hope i deserve it you do you should get some rest and swear his fealty to joffrey thats whinging this ones been killed six times you dont hear him bitching about it good lad jon the first time i went north of the wall was with your father he was a good man he deserved a better son were you with him at the end i was a prisoner of the wildlings but we avenged him youre sure this is the only copy in winterfell i want you to know that every mutineer found justice cant think of a worse way for him to go the nights watch was his life he would have died to protect every one of those men and they butchered him i hate that he died that way my father was the most honorable man i ever met he was good all the way through and he died on the executioners block ,4351
66,7,9.6,7,sansa stark she would if she thought i was going to betray jon i was only trying to protect her you and me both shes alive arya where  winterfell whos protecting her if youre here the only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way it wont be me tyrion here we are with the faces i can become someone else the heroes of blackwater bay strange place for a reunion it is my lord i dont think im anyones lord anymore podrick save the titles for ser bronn of the blackwater im sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne youve been thinking about our new queen perhaps youve been reconsidering your allegiances remember my offer i wonder what it would feel like to be the lady of winterfell whatever theyre paying you ill pay double and that would be double what now exactly dont you worry about me im doing all right looking after myself  tyrion are you helping me to arrange this meeting wasnt exactly looking after yourself was it you put yourself at risk i put yourself at risk important difference its your head queen cerseis offered a bag of gold for its not mine now thanks to me all id need to find out is your face shes got two traitors heads coming right through her door she can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes all thanks to ser bronn of the fucking blackwater if thats not looking after myself i dont know what is its good to see you again yeah you too anyone touches it ill kill you first come on pod lets you and me go have a drink daenerys will win this war while the fancy folks talk eh i left this shit city because i didnt want to die in it am i going to die in this shit city you might and this is all your idea seems every bad idea has some lannister cunt behind it and some clegane cunt to help them see it through remember me if you want cersei to bend the knee yeah you do youre even fucking uglier than i am now what did they do to you doesnt matter thats not how it ends for you brother you know whos coming for you youve always known where is she shell be here soon didnt travel with you you can ask her yourself no weve been here for some time my apologies we are all facing a unique euron theon i have your sister she has a more important request if you dont submit to me here now ill kill her i think we ought to begin with larger concerns then why are you talking youre the smallest concern here do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes his wasnt even good he explained it at the end never explain it always ruins it we dont even let your kind live cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing in the iron islands you know we kill you at birth an act of mercy for the parents perhaps you ought to sit down why sit down or leave we are a group of people who do not like one another as this recent demonstration has shown we have suffered at each others hands but a story what if we prove her wrong we have lost people we love at each others hands if all we wanted was more of the same there would be no need for this gathering we are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting facetoface so instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days we all know that will never happen then why are we here this isnt about living in harmony little theon come and get her bring the dead to her its just about living the same thing is coming for all of us a general you cant negotiate with an army that doesnt leave corpses behind on the battlefield lord tyrion tells me a million people live in this city theyre about to become a million more soldiers in the army of the dead i imagine for most of them it would be an improvement this is serious i wouldnt be here if it werent i dont think its serious at all i think its another bad joke if my brother jaime has informed me correctly youre asking me for a truce yes thats all thats all pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt or while you solidify and expand your position hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men go your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with you have my word the word of a wouldbe usurper there is no conversation that will erase the last  years we have something to show you we are going to destroy the night king and his army we can destroy them by burning them and we can destroy them with dragonglass if we dont win this fight then that is the fate of every person in the world there is only one war that matters the great war and it is here thank you my queen daenerys i didnt believe it until i saw them i saw them all how many a hundred thousand at least can they swim no good im taking the iron fleet back to the iron islands what are you talking about ive been around the world ive seen everything things you couldnt imagine and this this is the only thing ive ever seen that terrifies me im going back to my island you should go back to yours when winters over well be the only ones left alive cersei hes right to be afraid and a coward to run if those things come for us there will be no kingdoms to rule everything we suffered will have been for nothing everything we lost will have been for nothing the crown accepts your truce until the dead are defeated they are the true enemy in return the king in the north will extend this truce he will remain in the north where he belongs he will not take up arms against the lannisters he will not choose sides daenerys just the king in the north not me   i would never ask it of you you would never agree to it and if you did i would trust you even less than i do now i ask it only of ned starks son i know ned starks son will be true to his word i am true to my word or i try to be that is why i cannot give you what you ask bronn oil  pitch my lord i cannot serve two queens and i have already pledged myself to queen daenerys of house targaryen then there is nothing left to discuss the dead will come north first enjoy dealing with them we will deal with whatever is left of you brienne ser jaime its been good to see you i imagine the next time will be across a battlefield we both saw what just happened how many barrels   my lord we both saw that thing yes and im not looking forward to seeing more of them but im loyal to the queen and youre loyal to sansa and her dolt brother oh fuck loyalty fuck loyalty this goes beyond houses and honor and oaths talk to the queen and tell her what davos i wish you hadnt done that get  more im grateful for your loyalty but my dragon died so that we could be here if its all for nothing then he died for nothing i know im pleased you bent the knee to our queen i would have advised it had you asked but have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then just a bit yes my lord im not going to swear an oath i cant uphold talk about my father if you want tell me thats the attitude that got him killed but when enough people make false promises words stop meaning anything then there are no more answers only better and better lies and lies wont help us in this fight tyrion that is indeed a problem the more immediate problem is that were fucked any ideas as to how we might i still enjoy it when they call me my lord change that state of affairs only one everyone stays here and i go and talk to my sister i didnt come all this way to have my hand murdered i dont want cersei to murder me either i could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble jon i did this i should go  shell definitely murder you i go see my sister alone the thrill will fade or we all go home and were right back where we started you spoke with her  at her until she kicked me out she thinks i was an idiot to trust you a lot of people seem to think that actually im about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world whos already tried to kill me twice that i know of whos an idiot i suppose we should say goodbye if we live that long one idiot to another i shouldnt be surprised i suppose shes your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesnt know her place a foreign whore you cant abduct beat or intimidate that must be difficult for you so you bring her here with her pet northerner whom youve convinced to bow down before her  i didnt know about that and now youve got them both working towards the same goal the goal youve worked towards your entire life men without cocks cersei i didnt know  the destruction of this family i am the one preventing that from happening daenerys didnt want to debate and negotiate she didnt want to bring you words she wanted to bring you fire and blood until i advised her otherwise i dont want to destroy our family i never have you killed our father after he sentenced me to death you wouldnt find me fighting in an army for a crime i didnt commit yes i killed him hate me for it if you want i hate myself for it in spite of what he was in spite of what he did to me oh poor little man your papa was mean to you do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow you left us open you laid us bare for the vultures and the vultures came and tore us apart if i had no cock you may not have killed joffrey but you killed myrcella you killed tommen no one wouldve touched them if father was here no one would have dared  i have never been more sorry about anything i will not hear it not from you i will not hear it all right you love your family and i have destroyed it i will always be a threat whats left to fight for so put an end to me if it werent for me youd have a mother if it werent for me youd have a father if it werent for me youd have two beautiful children ive thought about killing you more times than i can count do it say the word gold i am more sorry about the children than you could ever know i will not  i dont care i loved them you know i did you know it in your heart if theres anything left of it it doesnt matter your love doesnt matter your feelings dont matter i dont care why you did what you did i only care what it cost us it cost us our future if theres no future then why are we here its an invitation to kings landing i spent my life around soldiers why did you allow me to come not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction yes no not what you hoped for but you must have hoped for something what did you hope for to make jon snow submit to your queen  mm not like this but eventually you want everyone to bend the knee to her yes  why because i think she will make the world a better place what do you think they spend that gold on you said shed destroy kings landing she knows herself she chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them thats the difference between you i dont care about checking my worst impulses i dont care about making the world a better place hang the world that thing you dragged here i know what it is i know what it means family and when it came at me i didnt think about the world not at all as soon as it opened its mouth the world disappeared for me right down its black throat all i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most away from my family maybe euron greyjoy had the right idea get on a boat take those who matter not without a cock you dont youre pregnant no one is less happy about this than i am i know i respect what you did wish you hadnt done it but i respect it this place was the beginning of the end for my family a dragon is not a slave they were terrifying maybe it really is all cocks in the end extraordinary they filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here they wasted away they grew small and we grew small as well we werent extraordinary without them we were just like everyone else youre not like everyone else and your family hasnt seen its end yet your brother has chosen to side with the cockless youre still here i cant have children who told you that the witch who murdered my husband has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information you were right from the beginning if i had trusted you everything would be different so what now i cant forget what i saw north of the wall yes hes always been a champion of the downtrodden and i cant pretend that cersei wont take back half the country the moment i march north it appears tyrions assessment was correct were fucked my armies will not stand down i will not pull them back to the capital i will march them north to fight alongside you in the great war the darkness is coming for us all well face it together and when the great war is over perhaps youll remember i chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you i expect not call our banners all of them littlefinger its not easy for ravens to fly in these storms perhaps jon tried to send word earlier no this is the way he is the way hes always been he never asked for my opinion why would he start now i cant believe hed surrender the northern crown without consulting you this is his writing his signature he pledged to fight for daenerys targaryen hes bent the knee ive heard gossip that the dragon queen is quite beautiful what does that have to do with anything jon is young and unmarried daenerys is young and unmarried you think he wants to marry her an alliance makes sense together theyd be difficult to defeat he was named king in the north he can be unnamed even if i wanted to arya would never go along she always loved jon far more than she ever loved me and shed kill anyone who betrayed her family you will represent my interests i think were about to be the downtrodden you are family too would arya really murder her own sister do you know what she is now do you know what the faceless men are only by reputation they worship the god of death i believe i never trust godly men theyre killers and arya was one of them what do you think shes after man archers stand tall shes your sister you know her far better than i ever could sometimes when i try to understand a persons motives i play a little game i assume the worst whats the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do then i ask myself how well does that reason explain what they say and what they do   man ua cover that wall so tell me whats the worst thing she could want she could want me dead because she thinks i wronged my family why did she come to winterfell to kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family why did she unearth the letter cersei made you write to provide proof of my betrayals to provide justification after she murders me and after she murders you what does she become lady of winterfell if we have the dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad theyll arrive at winterfell within the fortnight and the unsullied we can sail with them to white harbor meet the dothraki here on the kingsroad then ride together to winterfell how many people live here  a million give or take perhaps you should fly to winterfell your grace you have many enemies in the north thousands fell fighting your father all it takes is one angry man with a crossbow hell see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one wellplaced bolt will make him a hero the man who killed the conqueror jon its your decision your grace but if were going to be allies in this war its important for the northerners to see us as allies thats more people than the entire north crammed into that if we sail to white harbor together i think it sends a better message ive not come to conquer the north im coming to save the north we sail together jon can i speak with you all right what you did in kings landing what you said why would anyone want to live that way you couldve lied to cersei about bending the knee to daenerys you risked everything to tell an enemy the truth we went down there to make peace and it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if were going to fight together youve always known what was right even when we were all young and stupid you always knew every step you take theres more work in the city its always the right step its not it may seem that way from the outside but i promise you its not true ive done plenty of things that i regret not compared to me you havent no not compared to you i always wanted to do the right thing be the right kind of person and the brothels are far superior but i never knew what that meant it always seemed like theres like there was an impossible choice i had to make stark or greyjoy our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was he was  and you betrayed him betrayed his memory i did but you never lost him hes a part of you just like hes a part of me but the things ive done its not my place to forgive you for all of it but what i can forgive i do you dont need to choose youre a greyjoy and youre a stark when i was ramsays prisoner at this gathering as you see them yara tried to save me shes the only one who tried to save me she needs me now so why are you still talking to me harrag load up load up lads go on   tides coming in all of us chose to follow yara cersei why isnt she with them we left the iron islands for yara she would never leave one of us behind were not leaving her behind your sisters dead shes not dead  shes dead even if euron hasnt cut her throat yet shes dead shes our queen  shes your sister and you left her to die i did i ran from my uncle i was a coward qyburn im afraid i dont know your grace so why in fucks name should we listen to you they say the dead cant swim were going to sail east find a nice quiet island kill all the men and take their wives for ourselves were done with all that  who says we are yara did she made a pledge were going to find her and were going to set her free no one has seen her run away little theon its what you do best man he needs to shut his mouth man hey     man ua oh yes man ua thats more like it   stay down or ill kill you and the rest of them i said stay down or ill kill you not for me for yara theyre on their way to the dragonpit now men yara have my sister brought to the great hall are you sure you want to do this its not what i want its what honor demands and what does honor demand that i defend my family from those who would harm us that i defend the north from those who would betray us all right then get on with it you stand accused of murder including our brother you stand accused of treason how do you answer these charges lord baelish my sister asked you a question lady sansa forgive me im a bit confused which charges confuse you lets start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt lysa arryn you pushed her through the moon door and watched her fall yes your grace do you deny it i did it to protect you you did it to take power in the vale earlier you conspired to murder jon arryn you gave lysa tears of lys to poison him do you deny it whatever your aunt might have told you she was a troubled woman she imagined enemies everywhere you had aunt lysa send a letter to our parents if anything goes wrong telling them it was the lannisters who murdered jon arryn when really it was you the conflict between the starks and the lannisters it was you who started it do you deny it i know of no such letter you conspired with cersei lannister and joffrey baratheon to betray our father ned stark thanks to your treachery he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason kill the silverhaired bitch first do you deny it  i deny it none of you were there to see what happened none of you knows the truth you held a knife to his throat you said i did warn you not the trust me you told our mother this knife belonged to tyrion lannister but that was another one of your lies it was yours lady sansa i have known you since you were a girl ive protected you  protected me its not safe leaving you with littlefinger then our brother then the bastard who calls himself king by selling me to the boltons if we could speak alone i can explain everything sometimes when im trying to understand a persons motives i play a little game i assume the worst whats the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister thats what you do isnt it thats what youve always done the rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit turn family against family turn sister against sister thats what you did to our mother and aunt lysa and thats what you tried to do to us sansa please im a slow learner its true but i learn give me a chance to defend myself i deserve that i am lord protector of the vale come ser gregor and i command you to escort me safely back to the eyrie i think not sansa i beg you i loved your mother since the time i was a boy and yet you betrayed her i loved you more than anyone and yet you betrayed me when you brought me back to winterfell you told me theres no justice in the world its time for us to meet our guests not unless we make it thank you for all your many lessons lord baelish i will never forget them sansa i jaime our men in kings landing will march north in three days time man itll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train jaime we dont have a fortnight if the north falls we fall three days the remaining forces in the westerlands will take the river road east well meet at lord harroways town and march together to winterfell ser jaime your grace my lords i need a moment with my brother men your grace missandei why did they build it what are you doing  preparing the expedition north expedition north i always knew you were the stupidest lannister the starks and targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them are you a traitor or an idiot you pledged our forces to fight our common enemy ill say whatever i need to say to ensure the survival of our house you expect me to trust the man who murdered our father dragons dont understand the difference you expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum to fight for the dragon queen you saw it with your own eyes you saw a dead man trying to kill us i saw it burn if dragons cant stop them if dothraki and unsullied and northmen cant stop them how will our armies make a difference this isnt about noble houses this is about the living and the dead between what is theirs and what isnt and i intend to stay amongst the living let the stark boy and his new queen defend the north we stay here where weve always been i made a promise our child will rule westeros our child will never be born if the dead come south the monsters are real the white walkers the dragons the dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young theyre all real land livestock children so be it let the monsters kill each other and while they battle in the north we take back the lands that belong to us and then what  and then we rule when the fighting in the north is over someone wins you understand that dont you if the dead win they march south and kill us all if the living win and weve betrayed them they march south and kill us all letting them roam free around a city was a problem the targaryens and the starks already want to kill us all most of them will die in the north i faced them in the field we cant beat them we cant beat their dragons how many dragons did you see at the pit two  what happened to the third for all we know its guarding her fleet she came here with her dragons and her dothraki and her unsullied she came here to show us all her power no something happened the dragons are vulnerable littlefinger shes your sister i imagine it was a sad joke at the end we cant beat the dothraki we dont have the numbers we dont have the support of the other houses no we have something better we have the iron bank you shouldve listened more when father spoke about the importance of gold oh i know its boring for you you just wanted to hunt and ride and fight but i listened i learned highgarden bought us the most powerful army in essos the golden company men horses elephants i believe an entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs the golden company is not here theyre in essos how is a mercenary company in essos going to help us do you really think euron greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the iron islands do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen no one walks away from me hes sailing with his fleet to essos hes going to ferry the golden company back here but in the beginning when it was home to balerion the dread to help us win the war for westeros you plotted with euron greyjoy without telling me the commander of your armies and you conspired with tyrion the man who murdered our father without telling me your queen i didnt conspire with him you met with him in secret without my consent you planned to promote my enemies interests that is the definition of conspiracy it must have been the most dangerous place in the world i pledged to ride north i intend to honor that pledge and that will be treason  treason disobeying your queens command fighting with her enemies what would you call it doesnt matter what id call it i told you no one walks away from me are you going to order him to kill me im the only one you have left our children are gone our father is gone maybe it still is its just me and you now theres one more yet to come give the order then i dont believe you   come in samwell tarly i wasnt sure if youd remember me i remember everything welcome my lords you helped us get beyond the wall youre a good man  oh well thank you but um im not sure that i am what happened to you beyond the wall i became the threeeyed raven oh i dont know what that means i can see things that happened in the past i can see things happening now all over the world your friends arrived before you did why did you come to winterfell um jons the one to lead the fight against the dead i know he is but he cant do it alone so ive come here to help him hes on his way back to winterfell with daenerys targaryen you you saw this in in a vision ive been sent to escort you all to the meeting oh he needs to know the truth the truth about what about himself no one knows no one but me jon
